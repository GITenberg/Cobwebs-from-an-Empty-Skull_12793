    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>

    <p>The matter of which this volume is composed appeared
    originally in the columns of "FUN," when the wisdom of the
    Fables and the truth of the Tales tended to wholesomely
    diminish the levity of that jocund sheet. Their publication in
    a new form would seem to be a fitting occasion to say something
    as to their merit.</p>

    <p>Homer's "Iliad," it will be remembered, was but imperfectly
    appreciated by Homer's contemporaries. Milton's "Paradise Lost"
    was so lightly regarded when first written, that the author
    received but twenty-five pounds for it. Ben Jonson was for some
    time blind to the beauties of Shakespeare, and Shakespeare
    himself had but small esteem for his own work.</p>

    <p>Appearing each week in "FUN," these Fables and Tales very
    soon attracted the notice of the Editor, who was frank enough
    to say, afterward, that when he accepted the manuscript he did
    not quite perceive the quality of it. The printers, too, into
    whose hands it came, have since admitted that for some days
    they felt very little interest in it, and could not even make
    out what it was all about. When to these evidences I add the
    confession that at first I did not myself observe anything
    extraordinary in my work, I think I need say no more: the
    discerning public will note the parallel, and my modesty be
    spared the necessity of making an ass of itself.</p>

    <h2>FABLES OF ZAMBRI, THE PARSEE.</h2>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/008r.jpg"
             target="blank"><img width="600"
             src="images/008r.jpg"
             alt="Persian with Oyster" /></a>
    </div>

    <h3>I.</h3>

    <p>A certain Persian nobleman obtained from a cow gipsy a small
    oyster. Holding him up by the beard, he addressed him thus:</p>

    <p>"You must try to forgive me for what I am about to do; and
    you might as well set about it at once, for you haven't much
    time. I should never think of swallowing you if it were not so
    easy; but opportunity is the strongest of all temptations.
    Besides, I am an orphan, and very hungry."</p>

    <p>"Very well," replied the oyster; "it affords me genuine
    pleasure to comfort the parentless and the starving. I have
    already done my best for our friend here, of whom you purchased
    me; but although she has an amiable and accommodating stomach,
    <i>we <span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"
       id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span> couldn't agree</i>. For this
       trifling incompatibility&mdash;would you believe
       it?&mdash;she was about to stew me! Saviour, benefactor,
       proceed."</p>

    <p>"I think," said the nobleman, rising and laying down the
    oyster, "I ought to know something more definite about your
    antecedents before succouring you. If you couldn't agree with
    your mistress, you are probably no better than you should
    be."</p>

    <p>People who begin doing something from a selfish motive
    frequently drop it when they learn that it is a real
    benevolence.</p>

    <h3>II.</h3>

    <p>A rat seeing a cat approaching, and finding no avenue of
    escape, went boldly up to her, and said:</p>

    <p>"Madam, I have just swallowed a dose of powerful bane, and
    in accordance with instructions upon the label, have come out
    of my hole to die. Will you kindly direct me to a spot where my
    corpse will prove peculiarly offensive?"</p>

    <p>"Since you are so ill," replied the cat, "I will myself
    transport you to a spot which I think will suit."</p>

    <p>So saying, she struck her teeth through the nape of his neck
    and trotted away with him. This was more than he had bargained
    for, and he squeaked shrilly with the pain.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said the cat, "a rat who knows he has but a few
    minutes to live, never makes a fuss about a little agony. I
    don't think, my fine fellow, you have taken poison enough to
    hurt either you or me."</p>

    <p>So she made a meal of him.</p>

    <p>If this fable does not teach that a rat gets no profit by
    lying, I should be pleased to know what it does
    teach.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"
       id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>

    <h3>III.</h3>

    <p>A frog who had been sitting up all night in neighbourly
    converse with an echo of elegant leisure, went out in the grey
    of the morning to obtain a cheap breakfast. Seeing a tadpole
    approach,</p>

    <p>"Halt!" he croaked, "and show cause why I should not eat
    you."</p>

    <p>The tadpole stopped and displayed a fine tail.</p>

    <p>"Enough," said the frog: "I mistook you for one of us; and
    if there is anything I like, it is frog. But no frog has a
    tail, as a matter of course."</p>

    <p>While he was speaking, however, the tail ripened and dropped
    off, and its owner stood revealed in his edible character.</p>

    <p>"Aha!" ejaculated the frog, "so that is your little game!
    If, instead of adopting a disguise, you had trusted to my
    mercy, I should have spared you. But I am down upon all manner
    of deceit."</p>

    <p>And he had him down in a moment.</p>

    <p>Learn from this that he would have eaten him anyhow.</p>

    <h3>IV.</h3>

    <p>An old man carrying, for no obvious reason, a sheaf of
    sticks, met another donkey whose cargo consisted merely of a
    bundle of stones.</p>

    <p>"Suppose we swop," said the donkey.</p>

    <p>"Very good, sir," assented the old man; "lay your load upon
    my shoulders, and take off my parcel, putting it upon your own
    back."</p>

    <p>The donkey complied, so far as concerned his own
    encumbrance, but neglected to remove that of the other.</p>

    <p>"How clever!" said the merry old gentleman, "I knew you
    would do that. If you had done any
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
       id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span> differently there would have
       been no point to the fable."</p>

    <p>And laying down both burdens by the roadside, he trudged
    away as merry as anything.</p>

    <h3>V.</h3>

    <p>An elephant meeting a mouse, reproached him for not taking a
    proper interest in growth.</p>

    <p>"It is all very well," retorted the mouse, "for people who
    haven't the capacity for anything better. Let them grow if they
    like; but <i>I</i> prefer toasted cheese."</p>

    <p>The stupid elephant, not being able to make very much sense
    of this remark, essayed, after the manner of persons worsted at
    repartee, to set his foot upon his clever conqueror. In point
    of fact, he did set his foot upon him, and there wasn't any
    more mouse.</p>

    <p>The lesson imparted by this fable is open, palpable: mice
    and elephants look at things each after the manner of his kind;
    and when an elephant decides to occupy the standpoint of a
    mouse, it is unhealthy for the latter.</p>

    <h3>VI.</h3>

    <p>A wolf was slaking his thirst at a stream, when a lamb left
    the side of his shepherd, came down the creek to the wolf,
    passed round him with considerable ostentation, and began
    drinking below.</p>

    <p>"I beg you to observe," said the lamb, "that water does not
    commonly run uphill; and my sipping here cannot possibly defile
    the current where you are, even supposing my nose were no
    cleaner than yours, which it is. So you have not the flimsiest
    pretext for slaying me."</p>

    <p>"I am not aware, sir," replied the wolf, "that I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> require a pretext for loving
       chops; it never occurred to me that one was necessary."</p>

    <p>And he dined upon that lambkin with much apparent
    satisfaction.</p>

    <p>This fable ought to convince any one that of two stories
    very similar one needs not necessarily be a plagiarism.</p>

    <h3>VII.</h3>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/012r.jpg"
             target="blank"><img width="378"
             src="images/012r.jpg"
             alt="Old Gent in Oak Tree" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>An old gentleman sat down, one day, upon an acorn, and
    finding it a very comfortable seat, went soundly to sleep. The
    warmth of his body caused the acorn to germinate, and it grew
    so rapidly, that when the sleeper awoke he found himself
    sitting in the fork of an oak, sixty feet from the ground.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said he, "I am fond of having an extended view of any
    landscape which happens to please my fancy; but this one does
    not seem to possess that merit. I think I will go home."</p>

    <p>It is easier to say go home than to go.</p>

    <p>"Well, well!" he resumed, "if I cannot compel circumstances
    to my will, I can at least adapt my will to circumstances. I
    decide to remain. 'Life'&mdash;as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> a certain eminent philosopher
       in England wilt say, whenever there shall be an England to
       say it in&mdash;'is the definite combination of
       heterogeneous changes, both simultaneous and successive, in
       correspondence with external co-existences and sequences.' I
       have, fortunately, a few years of this before me yet; and I
       suppose I can permit my surroundings to alter me into
       anything I choose."</p>

    <p>And he did; but what a choice!</p>

    <p>I should say that the lesson hereby imparted is one of
    contentment combined with science.</p>

    <h3>VIII.</h3>

    <p>A caterpillar had crawled painfully to the top of a
    hop-pole, and not finding anything there to interest him, began
    to think of descending.</p>

    <p>"Now," soliloquized he, "if I only had a pair of wings, I
    should be able to manage it very nicely."</p>

    <p>So saying, he turned himself about to go down, but the heat
    of his previous exertion, and that of the sun, had by this time
    matured him into a butterfly.</p>

    <p>"Just my luck!" he growled, "I never wish for anything
    without getting it. I did not expect this when I came out this
    morning, and have nothing prepared. But I suppose I shall have
    to stand it."</p>

    <p>So he spread his pinions and made for the first open flower
    he saw. But a spider happened to be spending the summer in that
    vegetable, and it was not long before Mr. Butterfly was wishing
    himself back atop of that pole, a simple caterpillar.</p>

    <p>He had at last the pleasure of being denied a desire.</p>

    <p><i>H&aelig;c fabula docet</i> that it is not a good plan to
    call <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> at houses without first
       ascertaining who is at home there.</p>

    <h3>IX.</h3>

    <p>It is related of a certain Tartar priest that, being about
    to sacrifice a pig, he observed tears in the victim's eyes.</p>

    <p>"Now, I'd like to know what is the matter with <i>you</i>?"
    he asked.</p>

    <p>"Sir," replied the pig, "if your penetration were equal to
    that of the knife you hold, you would know without inquiring;
    but I don't mind telling you. I weep because I know I shall be
    badly roasted."</p>

    <p>"Ah," returned the priest, meditatively, having first killed
    the pig, "we are all pretty much alike: it is the bad roasting
    that frightens us. Mere death has no terrors."</p>

    <p>From this narrative learn that even priests sometimes get
    hold of only half a truth.</p>

    <h3>X.</h3>

    <p>A dog being very much annoyed by bees, ran, quite
    accidentally, into an empty barrel lying on the ground, and
    looking out at the bung-hole, addressed his tormenters
    thus:</p>

    <p>"Had you been temperate, stinging me only one at a time, you
    might have got a good deal of fun out of me. As it is, you have
    driven me into a secure retreat; for I can snap you up as fast
    as you come in through the bung-hole. Learn from this the folly
    of intemperate zeal."</p>

    <p>When he had concluded, he awaited a reply. There wasn't any

    went in the same way as he did, and made it very warm for
    him.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"

    <p>The lesson of this fable is that one cannot stick to his
    pure reason while quarrelling with bees.</p>

    <h3>XI.</h3>

    <p>A fox and a duck having quarrelled about the ownership of a
    frog, agreed to refer the dispute to a lion. After hearing a
    great deal of argument, the lion opened his mouth to speak.</p>

    <p>"I am very well aware," interrupted the duck, "what your
    decision is. It is that by our own showing the frog belongs to
    neither of us, and you will eat him yourself. But please
    remember that lions do not like frogs."</p>

    <p>"To me," exclaimed the fox, "it is perfectly clear that you
    will give the frog to the duck, the duck to me, and take me
    yourself. Allow me to state certain objections to&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I was about to remark," said the lion, "that while you were
    disputing, the cause of contention had hopped away. Perhaps you
    can procure another frog."</p>

    <p>To point out the moral of this fable would be to offer a
    gratuitous insult to the acuteness of the reader.</p>

    <h3>XII.</h3>

    <p>An ass meeting a pair of horses, late one evening, said to
    them:</p>

    <p>"It is time all honest horses were in bed. Why are you
    driving out at this time of day?"</p>

    <p>"Ah!" returned they, "if it is so very late, why are you out
    riding?"</p>

    <p>"I never in my life," retorted the ass angrily, "knew a
    horse to return a direct answer to a civil
    question."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"
       id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>

    <p>This tale shows that this ass did not know everything.</p>

    <p>[The implication that horses do not answer questions seems
    to have irritated the worthy fabulist.&mdash;TRANSLATOR.]</p>

    <h3>XIII.</h3>

    <p>A stone being cast by the plough against a lump of earth,
    hastened to open the conversation as follows:</p>

    <p>"Virtue, which is the opposite of vice, is best fostered by
    the absence of temptation!"</p>

    <p>The lump of earth, being taken somewhat by surprise, was not
    prepared with an apophthegm, and said nothing.</p>

    <p>Since that time it has been customary to call a stupid
    person a "clod."</p>

    <h3>XIV.</h3>

    <p>A river seeing a zephyr carrying off an anchor, asked him,
    "What are you going to do with it?"</p>

    <p>"I give it up," replied the zephyr, after mature
    reflection.</p>

    <p>"Blow me if <i>I</i> would!" continued the river; "you might
    just as well not have taken it at all."</p>

    <p>"Between you and me," returned the zephyr, "I only picked it
    up because it is customary for zephyrs to do such things. But
    if you don't mind I will carry it up to your head and drop it
    in your mouth."</p>

    <p>This fable teaches such a multitude of good things that it
    would be invidious to mention any.</p>

    <h3>XV.</h3>

    <p>A peasant sitting on a pile of stones saw an ostrich
    approaching, and when it had got within
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> range he began pelting it. It
       is hardly probable that the bird liked this; but it never
       moved until a large number of boulders had been discharged;
       then it fell to and ate them.</p>

    <p>"It was very good of you, sir," then said the fowl; "pray
    tell me to what virtue I am indebted for this excellent
    meal."</p>

    <p>"To piety," replied the peasant, who, believing that
    anything able to devour stones must be a god, was stricken with
    fear. "I beg you won't think these were merely cold victuals
    from my table; I had just gathered them fresh, and was
    intending to have them dressed for my dinner; but I am always
    hospitable to the deities, and now I suppose I shall have to go
    without."</p>

    <p>"On the contrary, my pious youth," returned the ostrich,
    "you shall go within."</p>

    <p>And the man followed the stones.</p>

    <p>The falsehoods of the wicked never amount to much.</p>

    <h3>XVI.</h3>

    <p>Two thieves went into a farmer's granary and stole a sack of
    kitchen vegetables; and, one of them slinging it across his
    shoulders, they began to run away. In a moment all the domestic
    animals and barn-yard fowls about the place were at their
    heels, in high clamour, which threatened to bring the farmer
    down upon them with his dogs.</p>

    <p>"You have no idea how the weight of this sack assists me in
    escaping, by increasing my momentum," said the one who carried
    the plunder; "suppose <i>you</i> take it."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" returned the other, who had been zealously pointing
    out the way to safety, and keeping foremost therein, "it is
    interesting to find how a common
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> danger makes people
       confiding. You have a thousand times said I could not be
       trusted with valuable booty. It is an humiliating
       confession, but I am myself convinced that if I should
       assume that sack, and the impetus it confers, you could not
       depend upon your dividend."</p>

    <p>"A common danger," was the reply, "seems to stimulate
    conviction, as well as confidence."</p>

    <p>"Very likely," assented the other, drily; "I am quite too
    busy to enter into these subtleties. You will find the subject
    very ably treated in the Zend-Avesta."</p>

    <p>But the bastinado taught them more in a minute than they
    would have gleaned from that excellent work in a fortnight.</p>

    <p>If they could only have had the privilege of reading this
    fable, it would have taught them more than
    either.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"

    <h3>XVII.</h3>

    <p>While a man was trying with all his might to cross a fence,
    a bull ran to his assistance, and taking him upon his horns,
    tossed him over. Seeing the man walking away without making any
    remark, the bull said:</p>

    <p>"You are quite welcome, I am sure. I did no more than my
    duty."</p>

    <p>"I take a different view of it, very naturally," replied the
    man, "and you may keep your polite acknowledgments of my
    gratitude until you receive it. I did not require your
    services."</p>

    <p>"You don't mean to say," answered the bull, "that you did
    not wish to cross that fence!"</p>

    <p>"I mean to say," was the rejoinder, "that I wished to cross
    it by my method, solely to avoid crossing it by yours."</p>

    <p><i>Fabula docet</i> that while the end is everything, the
    means is something.</p>

    <p>An hippopotamus meeting an open alligator, said to him:</p>

    <p>"My forked friend, you may as well collapse. You are not
    sufficiently comprehensive to embrace me. I am myself no tyro
    at smiling, when in the humour."</p>

    <p>"I really had no expectation of taking you in," replied the
    other. "I have a habit of extending my hospitality impartially
    to all, and about seven feet wide."</p>

    <p>"You remind me," said the hippopotamus, "of a certain zebra
    who was not vicious at all; he merely kicked the breath out of
    everything that passed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> behind him, but did not
       induce things to pass behind him."</p>

    <p>"It is quite immaterial what I remind you of," was the
    reply.</p>

    <p>The lesson conveyed by this fable is a very beautiful
    one.</p>

    <h3>XIX.</h3>

    <p>A man was plucking a living goose, when his victim addressed
    him thus:</p>

    <p>"Suppose <i>you</i> were a goose; do you think you would
    relish this sort of thing?"</p>

    <p>"Well, suppose I were," answered the man; "do you think
    <i>you</i> would like to pluck me?"</p>

    <p>"Indeed I would!" was the emphatic, natural, but injudicious
    reply.</p>

    <p>"Just so," concluded her tormentor; "that's the way <i>I</i>
    feel about the matter."</p>

    <h3>XX.</h3>

    <p>A traveller perishing of thirst in a desert, debated with
    his camel whether they should continue their journey, or turn
    back to an oasis they had passed some days before. The
    traveller favoured the latter plan.</p>

    <p>"I am decidedly opposed to any such waste of time," said the
    animal; "I don't care for oases myself."</p>

    <p>"I should not care for them either," retorted the man, with
    some temper, "if, like you, I carried a number of assorted
    water-tanks inside. But as you will not submit to go back, and
    I shall not consent to go forward, we can only remain where we
    are."</p>

    <p>"But," objected the camel, "that will be certain death to
    you!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>

    <p>"Not quite," was the quiet answer, "it involves only the
    loss of my camel."</p>

    <p>So saying, he assassinated the beast, and appropriated his
    liquid store.</p>

    <p>A compromise is not always a settlement satisfactory to both
    parties.</p>

    <h3>XXI.</h3>

    <p>A sheep, making a long journey, found the heat of his fleece
    very uncomfortable, and seeing a flock of other sheep in a
    fold, evidently awaiting for some one, leaped over and joined
    them, in the hope of being shorn. Perceiving the shepherd
    approaching, and the other sheep huddling into a remote corner
    of the fold, he shouldered his way forward, and going up to the
    shepherd, said:</p>

    <p>"Did you ever see such a lot of fools? It's lucky I came
    along to set them an example of docility. Seeing me operated
    upon, they 'll be glad to offer themselves."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps so," replied the shepherd, laying hold of the
    animal's horns; "but I never kill more than one sheep at a
    time. Mutton won't keep in hot weather."</p>

    <p>The chops tasted excellently well with tomato sauce.</p>

    <p>The moral of this fable isn't what you think it is. It is
    this: The chops of another man's mutton are <i>always</i> nice
    eating.</p>

    <h3>XXII.</h3>

    <p>Two travellers between Teheran and Bagdad met half-way up
    the vertical face of a rock, on a path only a cubit in width.
    As both were in a hurry, and etiquette would allow neither to
    set his foot <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> upon the other even if
       dignity had permitted prostration, they maintained for some
       time a stationary condition. After some reflection, each
       decided to jump round the other; but as etiquette did not
       warrant conversation with a stranger, neither made known his
       intention. The consequence was they met, with considerable
       emphasis, about four feet from the edge of the path, and
       went through a flight of soaring eagles, a mile out of their
       way!<a id="footnotetagA"

    <p>A stone which had lain for centuries in a hidden place
    complained to Allah that remaining so long in one position was
    productive of cramps.</p>

    <p>"If thou wouldst be pleased," it said, "to let me take a
    little exercise now and then, my health would be the better for
    it."</p>

    <p>So it was granted permission to make a short excursion, and
    at once began rolling out into the open desert. It had not
    proceeded far before an ostrich, who was pensively eating a keg
    of nails, left his repast, dashed at the stone, and gobbled it
    up.</p>

    <p>This narration teaches the folly of contentment: if the
    ostrich had been content with his nails he would never have
    eaten the stone.</p>

    I will reward you by rearing a fresh ladder especially for
    you."</p>

    <p>"This one is quite good enough for a hog," was the reply;
    "but I am curious to know if you will keep your promise, so
    I'll just amuse myself until you come down."</p>

    <p>And taking the bottom rung in his mouth, he moved off, away
    from the wall. A moment later he had all the loose corn he
    could garner, but he never got that other ladder.</p>

    <p>A young cock and a hen were speaking of the size of eggs.
    Said the cock:</p>

    <p>"Oh, you did!" interrupted the hen, with a derisive cackle.
    "Pray how did you manage it?"</p>

    <p>The cock felt injured in his self-esteem, and, turning his
    back upon the hen, addressed himself to a brood of young
    chickens.</p>

    <p>The chickens chirped incredulously, and passed on. The
    insulted bird reddened in the wattles with indignation, and
    strutting up to the patriarch of the entire barn-yard, repeated
    his assertion. The patriarch nodded gravely, as if the feat
    were an every-day affair, and the other continued:</p>

    <p>"I once laid an egg alongside a water-melon, and compared
    the two. The vegetable was considerably the
    larger."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"

    <p>Two whales seizing a pike, attempted in turn to swallow him,

    <p>A wolf went into the cottage of a peasant while the family
    was absent in the fields, and falling foul of some beef, was
    quietly enjoying it, when he was observed by a domestic rat,
    who went directly to her master, informing him of what she had
    seen.</p>

    <p>"I would myself have dispatched the robber," she added, "but
    feared you might wish to take him alive."</p>

    <p>So the man secured a powerful club and went to the door of
    the house, while the rat looked in at the window. After taking
    a survey of the situation, the man said:</p>

    <p>"I don't think I care to take this fellow alive. Judging
    from his present performance, I should say his keeping would
    entail no mean expense. You may go in and slay him if you like;
    I have quite changed my mind."</p>

    <p>"If you really intended taking him prisoner," replied the
    rat, "the object of that bludgeon is to me a matter of mere
    conjecture. However, it is easy enough to see you have changed
    your mind; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> it may be barely worth
       mentioning that I have changed mine."</p>

    <p>"The interest you both take in me," said the wolf, without
    looking up, "touches me deeply. As you have considerately
    abstained from bothering me with the question of how I am to be
    disposed of, I will not embarrass your counsels by obtruding a
    preference. Whatever may be your decision, you may count on my
    acquiescence; my countenance alone ought to convince you of the
    meek docility of my character. I never lose my temper, and I
    never swear; but, by the stomach of the Prophet! if either one
    of you domestic animals is in sight when I have finished the
    conquest of these ribs, the question of <i>my</i> fate may be
    postponed for future debate, without detriment to any important
    interest."</p>

    <p>This fable teaches that while you are considering the
    abatement of a nuisance, it is important to know which nuisance
    is the more likely to be abated.</p>

    tunic; "but you will observe that my skin is brief and open. If

    <p>With this he inserted his paw, and scooped out the animal's
    essential part.</p>

    <p>"Now," said he, eating the portion he had removed, "I think

    proceeded, with much tender solicitude, to extract the thorn.
    Just as she had done so, the sentinel gave the alarm.</p>

    <p>"How near are they?" asked the mother.</p>

    <p>"Close by, in the next field," was the answer.</p>

    <p>"The deuce they are!" was the hasty rejoinder. "However, I
    presume they will be content with a single fox."</p>

    <p>And shoving the thorn earnestly back into the wounded foot,
    this excellent parent took to her heels.</p>

    down his paddle and said:</p>

    <p>"Whoever you are that ask me to stop, I beg you will let me
    go on. I have been asked by a friend to dine with him, and I am
    late."</p>

    <p>"Should your friend pass this way," said the voice, "I will
    show him the cause of your detention. Meantime you must come to
    dinner with <i>me</i>. "</p>

    <p>"Willingly," replied the man, devoutly, very well pleased
    with so extraordinary an honour; "pray show me the way."</p>

    <p>"In here," said the crocodile, elevating his distending jaws
    above the water and beckoning with his tongue&mdash;"this way,

    the same thing as being asked to dine.</p>

    young monkeys, thinking he was about to beat them, set upon

    <p>A wild horse meeting a domestic one, taunted him with his
    condition of servitude. The tamed animal claimed that he was as
    free as the wind.</p>

    <p>"If that is so," said the other, "pray tell me the office of
    that bit in your mouth."</p>

    <p>"That," was the answer, "is iron, one of the best tonics in
    the <i>materia medica</i>."</p>

    <p>"But what," said the other, "is the meaning of the rein
    attached to it?"</p>

    <p>"Keeps it from falling out of my mouth when I am too
    indolent to hold it," was the reply.</p>

    <p>"How about the saddle?"</p>

    <p>"Fool!" was the angry retort; "its purpose is to spare me
    fatigue: when I am tired, I get on and ride."</p>

    <h3>XXXV.</h3>

    <p>Some doves went to a hawk, and asked him to protect them
    from a kite.</p>

    <p>"That I will," was the cheerful reply; "and when I am
    admitted into the dovecote, I shall kill more of you in a day
    than the kite did in a century. But of course you know this;
    you expect to be treated in the regular way."</p>

    <p>So he entered the dovecote, and began preparations for a
    general slaughter. But the doves all set upon him and made
    exceedingly short work of him. With his last breath he asked
    them why, being so formidable, they had not killed the kite.
    They replied that they had never seen any
    kite.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"

    <p>A defeated warrior snatched up his aged father, and,

    followed by the weary remnant of his beaten army. The old

    <p>"See!" said he, triumphantly, to the flying legion; "did you
    ever hear of so dutiful and accommodating a son? And he's as
    easy under the saddle as an old family horse!"</p>

    <p>"I rather think," replied the broken and disordered
    battalion, with a grin, "that Mr. &AElig;neas once did
    something of this kind. But <i>his</i> father had thoughtfully
    taken an armful of lares and penates; and the accommodating

    the heaviest of those dead branches, I think the merits of my

    <p>A pig who had engaged a cray-fish to pilot him along the
    beach in search of mussels, was surprised to see his guide
    start off backwards.</p>

    <p>"Your excessive politeness quite overcomes me," said the
    porker, "but don't you think it rather ill bestowed upon a pig?
    Pray don't hesitate to turn your back upon me."</p>

    <p>"Sir," replied the cray-fish, "permit me to continue as I
    am. We now stand to each other in the proper relation of
    <i>employ&eacute;</i> to employer. The former is excessively
    obsequious, and the latter is, in the eyes of the former, a

    <h3>XXXVIII.</h3>

    <p>The king of tortoises desiring to pay a visit of ceremony to
    a neighbouring monarch, feared that in his absence his idle
    subjects might get up a revolution, and that whoever might be
    left at the head of the State would usurp the throne. So
    calling his subjects about him, he addressed them thus:</p>

    <p>"I am about to leave our beloved country for a long period,
    and desire to leave the sceptre in the hands of him who is most
    truly a tortoise. I decree that you shall set out from yonder
    distant tree, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> pass round it. Whoever shall
       get back last shall be appointed Regent."</p>

    <p>So the population set out for the goal, and the king for his
    destination. Before the race was decided, his Majesty had made
    the journey and returned. But he found the throne occupied by a
    subject, who at once secured by violence what he had won by
    guile.</p>

    <p>Certain usurpers are too conscientious to retain kingly
    power unless the rightful monarch be dead; and these are the
    most dangerous sort.</p>

    <p>A spaniel at the point of death requested a mastiff friend

    <p>"It would soothe my last moments," said he, "to know that
    when I am no longer of any importance to myself I may still be
    useful to you."</p>

    <p>"Much obliged, I am sure," replied his friend; "I think you
    mean well, but you should know that my appetite is not so
    depraved as to relish dog."</p>

    <p>Perhaps it is for a similar reason we abstain from

    <p>A cloud was passing across the face of the sun, when the
    latter expostulated with him.</p>

    <p>"Why," said the sun, "when you have so much space to float
    in, should you be casting your cold shadow upon me?"</p>

    <p>After a moment's reflection, the cloud made answer thus:</p>

    <p>"I certainly had no intention of giving offence by my
    presence, and as for my shadow, don't you think you have made a
    trifling mistake?&mdash;not a gigantic or absurd mistake, but
    merely one that would disgrace an
    idiot."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"

    <p>At this the great luminary was furious, and fell so hotly
    upon him that in a few minutes there was nothing of him
    left.</p>

    <h3>XLII.</h3>

    <p>A fox who dwelt in the upper chamber of an abandoned
    watch-tower, where he practised all manner of magic, had by
    means of his art subjected all other animals to his will. One
    day he assembled a great multitude of them below his window,
    and commanded that each should appear in his presence, and all
    who could not teach him some important truth should be thrown
    off the walls and dashed to pieces. Upon hearing this they were
    all stricken with grief, and began to lament their hard fate
    most piteously.</p>

    <p>"How," said they, "shall we, who are unskilled in magic,
    unread in philosophy, and untaught in the secrets of the
    stars&mdash;who have neither wit, eloquence,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> nor song&mdash;how shall we
       essay to teach wisdom to the wise?"</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, they were compelled to make the attempt. After
    many had failed and been dispatched, another fox arrived on the
    ground, and learning the condition of affairs, scampered slyly
    up the steps, and whispered something in the ear of the cat,
    who was about entering the tower. So the latter stuck her head
    in at the door, and shrieked:</p>

    <p>"Pullets with a southern exposure ripen earliest, and have
    yellow legs."</p>

    <p>At this the magician was so delighted that he dissolved the
    spell and let them all go free.</p>

    <h3>XLIII.</h3>

    <p>One evening a jackass, passing between a village and a hill,
    looked over the latter and saw the faint light of the rising
    moon.</p>

    <p>"Ho-ho, Master Redface!" said he, "so you are climbing up
    the other side to point out my long ears to the villagers, are
    you? I'll just meet you at the top, and set my heels into your
    insolent old lantern."</p>

    <p>So he scrambled painfully up to the crest, and stood
    outlined against the broad disc of the unconscious luminary,
    more conspicuously a jackass than ever before.</p>

    <h3>XLIV.</h3>

    <p>A bear wishing to rob a beehive, laid himself down in front
    of it, and overturned it with his paw.</p>

    <p>"Now," said he, "I will lie perfectly still and let the bees
    sting me until they are exhausted and powerless; their honey
    may then be obtained without
    opposition."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"

    <p>"I would not eat that, if I were you, for I think it is
    poisoned. However, if you will allow me to examine it, I will
    tell you certainly whether it is or not."</p>

    <p>While the mouse was thinking what it was best to do, the cat
    had fully made up her mind, and was kind enough to examine both
    the cheese and the mouse in a manner highly satisfactory to
    herself, but the mouse has never returned to give <i>his</i>
    opinion.</p>

    <h3>XLVI.</h3>

    <p>An improvident man, who had quarrelled with his wife
    concerning household expenses, took her and the children out on
    the lawn, intending to make an example of her. Putting himself
    in an attitude of aggression, and turning to his offspring, he
    said:</p>

    <p>"You will observe, my darlings, that domestic offences are
    always punished with a loss of blood. Make a note of this and
    be wise."</p>

    <p>He had no sooner spoken than a starving mosquito settled
    upon his nose, and began to assist in enforcing the lesson.</p>

    <p>"My officious friend," said the man, "when I require
    illustrations from the fowls of the air, you may command my
    patronage. The deep interest you take in my affairs is, at
    present, a trifle
    annoying."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"

    <p>"I do not find it so," the mosquito would have replied had
    he been at leisure, "and am convinced that our respective
    points of view are so widely dissimilar as not to afford the
    faintest hope of reconciling our opinions upon collateral
    points. Let us be thankful that upon the main question of
    bloodletting we perfectly agree."</p>

    <p>When the bird had concluded, the man's convictions were
    quite unaltered, but he was too weak to resume the discussion;
    and, although blood is thicker than water, the children were
    constrained to confess that the stranger had the best of

    <p>"Quite dreadful!" replied the man, eyeing him with an
    evident purpose: "almost impossible to obtain meat."</p>

    <p>"Plenty of meat, such as it is, but no corn. Do you know, I
    have been compelled to eat so many of your people, I don't
    believe there is an ounce of pork in my composition."</p>

    <p>"And I so many that I have lost all taste for pork."</p>

    <p>"Terrible thing this cannibalism!"</p>

    <p>"Depends upon which character you try it in; it is terrible
    to be eaten."</p>

    <p>A snake, a mile long, having drawn himself over a roc's egg,
    complained that in its present form he could get no benefit

    way.</p>

    <p>"Certainly," assented the bird, "I think we can arrange
    it."</p>

    <p>Saying which, she snatched up one of the smaller Persian
    provinces, and poising herself a few leagues above the
    suffering reptile, let it drop upon him to smash the egg.</p>

    won't bite you."</p>

    <p>The man gave one stare and dashed across the meadows.</p>

    <p>"Well," said a sheep, "I wouldn't be afraid of a horse;
    <i>he</i> won't kick."</p>

    <p>The man shot like a comet into the forest.</p>

    <p>"Look where you're going there, or I'll thrash the life out

    blundered.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"

    <p>Frantic with fear, the man leapt into the sea.</p>

    <p>The man was dejected, and felt a sense of injury. He seated
    himself moodily on the bottom, braced up his chin with his
    knees, and thought for an hour. Then he beckoned to the fish

    <p>"If I choose to stand upside down," replied the man, "I am
    very well aware that I incur the displeasure of those who
    adhere with slavish tenacity to the prejudices and traditions
    of society; but it seems to me that rebuke would come with a
    more consistent grace from one who does not wear a tail upon

    <p>A dog meeting a strange cat, took her by the top of the
    back, and shook her for a considerable period with some
    earnestness. Then depositing her in a ditch, he remarked with
    gravity:</p>

    <p>"There, my feline friend! I think that will teach you a
    wholesome lesson; and as punishment is intended to be
    reformatory, you ought to be grateful to me for deigning to
    administer it."</p>

    <p>"I don't think of questioning your right to worry me," said
    the cat, getting her breath, "but I should like to know where
    you got your licence to preach at me. Also, if not inconsistent
    with the dignity of the court, I should wish to be informed of
    the nature of my offence; in order that I may the more clearly
    apprehend the character of the lesson imparted by its
    punishment."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>

    <p>"Since you are so curious," replied the dog, "I worry you
    because you are too feeble to worry me."</p>

    <p>"In other words," rejoined the cat, getting herself together
    as well as she could, "you bite me for that to which you owe
    your existence."</p>

    <p>The reply of the dog was lost in the illimitable field of
    ether, whither he was just then projected by the kick of a
    passing horse. The moral of this fable cannot be given until he
    shall get down, and close the conversation with the regular
    apophthegm.</p>

    <h3>LIV.</h3>

    <p>People who wear tight hats will do well to lay this fable
    well to heart, and ponder upon the deep significance of its
    moral:</p>

    <p>In passing over a river, upon a high bridge, a cow
    discovered a broad loose plank in the flooring, sustained in
    place by a beam beneath the centre.</p>

    <p>"Now," said she, "I will stand at this end of the trap, and
    when yonder sheep steps upon the opposite extreme there will be
    an upward tendency in wool."</p>

    <p>So when the meditative mutton advanced unwarily upon the
    treacherous device, the cow sprang bodily upon the other end,
    and there was a fall in beef.</p>

    <h3>LV.</h3>

    <p>Two snakes were debating about the proper method of
    attacking prey.</p>

    <p>"The best way," said one, "is to slide cautiously up,
    endwise, and seize it thus"&mdash;illustrating his method by
    laying hold of the other's tail.</p>

    <p>"Not at all," was the reply; "a better plan is to approach
    by a circular side-sweep, thus"&mdash;turning upon his opponent
    and taking in <i>his</i>
    tail.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>

    <p>Although there was no disagreement as to the manner of
    disposing of what was once seized, each began to practise his
    system upon the other, and continued until both were
    swallowed.</p>

    <p>"But if I were a sack of gold, do you think you would find
    me very onerous?" said the burden.</p>

    <p>"A great deal would depend," was the answer, "upon whom you
    happened to belong to; but I may say, generally, that gold upon
    the shoulders is wonderfully light, considering the weight of
    it."</p>

    <p>"Behold," said the burden, "the folly of mankind: they
    cannot perceive that the <i>quality</i> of the burdens of life
    is a matter of no importance. The question of pounds and ounces
    is the only consideration of any real weight."</p>

    <h3>LVII.</h3>

    <p>A ghost meeting a genie, one wintry night, said to him:</p>

    <p>"Extremely harassing weather, friend. Wish I had some teeth
    to chatter!"</p>

    <p>"You do not need them," said the other; "you can always
    chatter those of other people, by merely showing yourself. For
    my part, I should be content with some light employment: would
    erect a cheap palace, transport a light-weight princess,
    threaten a small cripple&mdash;or jobs of that kind. What are
    the prospects of the fool crop?"</p>

    <p>"For the next few thousand years, very good. There is a sort
    of thing called Literature coming in shortly, and it will make
    our fortune. But it will be very bad for History. Curse this
    phantom apparel! The more I gather it about me the colder I
    get."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>

    <p>"When Literature has made our fortune," sneered the genie,
    "I presume you will purchase material clothing."</p>

    <p>"And you," retorted the ghost, "will be able to advertise
    for permanent employment at a fixed salary."</p>

    <p>This fable shows the difference between the super natural
    and the natural "super": the one appears in the narrative, the
    other does not.</p>

    <h3>LVIII.</h3>

    <p>"Permit me to help you on in the world, sir," said a boy to
    a travelling tortoise, placing a glowing coal upon the animal's
    back.</p>

    <p>"Thank you," replied the unconscious beast; "I alone am
    responsible for the time of my arrival, and I alone will
    determine the degree of celerity required. The gait I am going
    will enable me to keep all my present appointments."</p>

    <p>A genial warmth began about this time to pervade his upper
    crust, and a moment after he was dashing away at a pace
    comparatively tremendous.</p>

    <p>"How about those engagements?" sneered the grinning
    urchin.</p>

    <p>"I've recollected another one," was the hasty reply.</p>

    <h3>LIX.</h3>

    <p>Having fastened his gaze upon a sparrow, a rattlesnake
    sprung open his spanning jaws, and invited her to enter.</p>

    <p>"I should be most happy," said the bird, not daring to
    betray her helpless condition, but anxious by any subterfuge to
    get the serpent to remove his fascinating regard, "but I am
    lost in contemplation of yonder green sunset, from which I am
    unable to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> look away for more than a
       minute. I shall turn to it presently."</p>

    <p>"Do, by all means," said the serpent, with a touch of irony
    in his voice. "There is nothing so improving as a good, square,
    green sunset."</p>

    <p>"Did you happen to observe that man standing behind you with
    a club?" continued the sparrow. "Handsome fellow! Fifteen
    cubits high, with seven heads, and very singularly attired;
    quite a spectacle in his way."</p>

    <p>"I don't seem to care much for men," said the snake. "Every
    way inferior to serpents&mdash;except in malice."</p>

    <p>"But he is accompanied by a <i>really interesting</i>
    child," persisted the bird, desperately.</p>

    <p>The rattlesnake reflected deeply. He soliloquized as
    follows:</p>

    <p>"There is a mere chance&mdash;say about one chance to ten
    thousand million&mdash;that this songster is speaking the
    truth. One chance in ten thousand million of seeing a really
    interesting child is worth the sacrifice demanded; I'll make
    it."</p>

    <p>So saying, he removed his glittering eyes from the bird (who
    immediately took wing) and looked behind him. It is needless to
    say there was no really interesting child there&mdash;nor
    anywhere else.</p>

    <p>MORAL.&mdash;Mendacity (so called from the inventors) is a
    very poor sort of dacity; but it will serve your purpose if you
    draw it sufficiently strong.</p>

    <h3>LX.</h3>

    <p>A man who was very much annoyed by the incursions of a lean
    ass belonging to his neighbour, resolved to compass the
    destruction of the invader.</p>

    <p>"Now," said he, "if this animal shall choose to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> starve himself to death in
       the midst of plenty, the law will not hold <i>me</i> guilty
       of his blood. I have read of a trick which I think will
       'fix' him."</p>

    <p>So he took two bales of his best hay, and placed them in a
    distant field, about forty cubits apart. By means of a little
    salt he then enticed the ass in, and coaxed him between the
    bundles.</p>

    <p>"There, fiend!" said he, with a diabolic grin, as he walked
    away delighted with the success of his stratagem, "now hesitate
    which bundle of hay to attack first, until you
    starve&mdash;monster!"</p>

    <p>Some weeks afterwards he returned with a wagon to convey
    back the bundles of hay. There wasn't any hay, but the wagon
    was useful for returning to his owner that unfortunate
    ass&mdash;who was too fat to walk.</p>

    <p>This ought to show any one the folly of relying upon the
    teaching of obscure and inferior authors.<a id="footnotetagB"

    <h3>LXI.</h3>

    <p>One day the king of the wrens held his court for the trial
    of a bear, who was at large upon his own recognizance. Being
    summoned to appear, the animal came with great humility into
    the royal presence.</p>

    <p>"What have you to say, sir," demanded the king, "in defence
    of your inexcusable conduct in pillaging the nests of our loyal
    subjects wherever you can find them?"</p>

    <p>"May it please your Majesty," replied the prisoner, with a
    reverential gesture, repeated at intervals, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> each time at a less distance
       from the royal person, "I will not wound your Majesty's
       sensibilities by pleading a love of eggs; I will humbly
       confess my course of crime, warn your Majesty of its
       probable continuance, and beg your Majesty's gracious
       permission to inquire&mdash;What is your Majesty going to do
       about it?"</p>

    <p>The king and his ministers were very much struck with this
    respectful speech, with the ingenuity of the final inquiry, and
    with the bear's paw. It was the paw, however, which made the
    most lasting impression.</p>

    <p>Always give ear to the flattery of your powerful inferiors:
    it will cheer you in your decline.</p>

    <h3>LXII.</h3>

    <p>A philosopher looking up from the pages of the Zend-Avesta,
    upon which he had been centring his soul, beheld a pig
    violently assailing a cauldron of cold slops.</p>

    <p>"Heaven bless us!" said the sage; "for unalloyed delight
    give me a good honest article of Sensuality. So soon as my
    'Essay upon the Correlation of Mind-forces' shall have brought
    me fame and fortune, I hope to abjure the higher faculties,
    devoting the remainder of my life to the cultivation of the
    propensities."</p>

    <p>"Allah be praised!" soliloquized the pig, "there is nothing
    so godlike as Intellect, and nothing so ecstatic as
    intellectual pursuits. I must hasten to perform this gross
    material function, that I may retire to my wallow and resign my
    soul to philosophical meditation."</p>

    <p>This tale has one moral if you are a philosopher, and
    another if you are a
    pig.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"

    <h3>LXIII.</h3>

    <p>"Awful dark&mdash;isn't it?" said an owl, one night, looking
    in upon the roosting hens in a poultry-house; "don't see how I
    am to find my way back to my hollow tree."</p>

    <p>"There is no necessity," replied the cock; "you can roost
    there, alongside the door, and go home in the morning."</p>

    <p>"Thanks!" said the owl, chuckling at the fool's simplicity;
    and, having plenty of time to indulge his facetious humour, he
    gravely installed himself upon the perch indicated, and
    shutting his eyes, counterfeited a profound slumber. He was
    aroused soon after by a sharp constriction of the throat.</p>

    <p>"I omitted to tell you," said the cock, "that the seat you
    happen by the merest chance to occupy is a contested one, and
    has been fruitful of hens to this vexatious weasel. I don't
    know <i>how</i> often I have been partially widowed by the
    sneaking villain."</p>

    <p>For obvious reasons there was no audible reply.</p>

    <p>This narrative is intended to teach the folly&mdash;the
    worse than sin!&mdash;of trumping your partner's ace.</p>

    <h3>LXIV.</h3>

    <p>A fat cow who saw herself detected by an approaching horse
    while perpetrating stiff and ungainly gambols in the spring
    sunshine, suddenly assumed a severe gravity of gait, and a
    sedate solemnity of expression that would have been creditable
    to a Brahmin.</p>

    <p>"Fine morning!" said the horse, who, fired by her example,
    was curvetting lithely and tossing his head.</p>

    <p>"That rather uninteresting fact," replied the cow,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
       id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> attending strictly to her
       business as a ruminant, "does not impress me as justifying
       your execution of all manner of unseemly contortions, as a
       preliminary to accosting an entire stranger."</p>

    <p>"Well, n&mdash;no," stammered the horse; "I&mdash;I suppose
    not. Fact is I&mdash;I&mdash;no offence, I hope."</p>

    <p>And the unhappy charger walked soberly away, dazed by the
    preternatural effrontery of that placid cow.</p>

    <p>When overcome by the dignity of any one you chance to meet,

    <h3>LXV.</h3>

    <p>"What have you there on your back?" said a zebra, jeeringly,
    to a "ship of the desert" in ballast.</p>

    <p>"Only a bale of gridirons," was the meek reply.</p>

    <p>"And what, pray, may you design doing with them?" was the
    incredulous rejoinder.</p>

    <p>"What am I to do with gridirons?" repeated the camel,
    contemptuously. "Nice question for <i>you</i>, who have
    evidently just come off one!"</p>

    <p>People who wish to throw stones should not live in glass
    houses; but there ought to be a few in their vicinity.</p>

    <h3>LXVI.</h3>

    <p>A cat, waking out of a sound sleep, saw a mouse sitting just
    out of reach, observing her. Perceiving that at the slightest
    movement of hers the mouse would recollect an engagement, she
    put on a look of extreme amiability, and said:</p>

    <p>"Oh! it's you, is it? Do you know, I thought at first you
    were a frightful great rat; and I am <i>so</i> afraid of rats!
    I feel so much relieved&mdash;you don't know! Of course you
    have heard that I am a great friend to the dear little
    mice?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"

    <p>"Yes," was the answer, "I have heard that you love us
    indifferently well, and my mission here was to bless you while
    you slept. But as you will wish to go and get your breakfast, I
    won't bore you. Fine morning&mdash;isn't it? <i>Au
    revoir!"</i></p>

    <p>This fable teaches that it is usually safe to avoid one who
    pretends to be a friend without having any reason to be. It
    wasn't safe in this instance, however; for the cat went after
    that departing rodent, and got away with him.</p>

    <h3>LXVII.</h3>

    <p>A man pursued by a lion, was about stepping into a place of
    safety, when he bethought him of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> the power of the human eye;
       and, turning about, he fixed upon his pursuer a steady look
       of stern reproof. The raging beast immediately moderated his
       rate per hour, and finally came to a dead halt, within a
       yard of the man's nose. After making a leisurely survey of
       him, he extended his neck and bit off a small section of his
       victim's thigh.</p>

    <p>"Beard of Arimanes!" roared the man; "have you no respect
    for the Human Eye?"</p>

    <p>"I hold the human eye in profound esteem," replied the lion,
    "and I confess its power. It assists digestion if taken just
    before a meal. But I don't understand why you should have two
    and I none."</p>

    <p>With that he raised his foot, unsheathed his claws, and
    transferred one of the gentleman's visual organs to his own
    mouth.</p>

    <p>"Now," continued he, "during the brief remainder of a
    squandered existence, your lion-quelling power, being more
    highly concentrated, will be the more easily managed."</p>

    <p>He then devoured the remnant of his victim, including the
    other eye.</p>

    <h3>LXVIII.</h3>

    <p>An ant laden with a grain of corn, which he had acquired
    with infinite toil, was breasting a current of his fellows,
    each of whom, as is their etiquette, insisted upon stopping
    him, feeling him all over, and shaking hands. It occurred to
    him that an excess of ceremony is an abuse of courtesy. So he
    laid down his burden, sat upon it, folded all his legs tight to
    his body, and smiled a smile of great grimness.</p>

    <p>"Hullo! what's the matter with <i>you</i>?" exclaimed the
    first insect whose overtures were declined.</p>

    <p>"Sick of the hollow conventionalities of a rotten
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> civilization," was the
       rasping reply. "Relapsed into the honest simplicity of
       primitive observances. Go to grass!"</p>

    <p>"Ah! then we must trouble you for that corn. In a condition
    of primitive simplicity there are no rights of property, you
    know. These are 'hollow conventionalities.'"</p>

    <p>A light dawned upon the intellect of that pismire. He shook
    the reefs out of his legs; he scratched the reverse of his ear;
    he grappled that cereal, and trotted away like a giant
    refreshed. It was observed that he submitted with a wealth of
    patience to manipulation by his friends and neighbours, and
    went some distance out of his way to shake hands with strangers
    on competing lines of traffic.</p>

    <h3>LXIX.</h3>

    <p>A snake who had lain torpid all winter in his hole took
    advantage of the first warm day to limber up for the spring
    campaign. Having tied himself into an intricate knot, he was so
    overcome by the warmth of his own body that he fell asleep, and
    did not wake until nightfall. In the darkness he was unable to
    find his head or his tail, and so could not disentangle and
    slide into his hole. Per consequence, he froze to death.</p>

    <p>Many a subtle philosopher has failed to solve himself, owing

    <h3>LXX.</h3>

    <p>A dog finding a joint of mutton, apparently guarded by a
    negligent raven, stretched himself before it with an air of
    intense satisfaction.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said he, alternately smiling and stopping
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> up the smiles with meat,
       "this is an instrument of salvation to my stomach&mdash;an
       instrument upon which I love to perform."</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon!" said the bird; "it was placed there
    specially for me, by one whose right to so convey it is beyond
    question, he having legally acquired it by chopping it off the
    original owner."</p>

    <p>"I detect no flaw in your abstract of title," replied the
    dog; "all seems quite regular; but I must not provoke a breach
    of the peace by lightly relinquishing what I might feel it my
    duty to resume by violence. I must have time to consider; and
    in the meantime I will dine."</p>

    <p>Thereupon he leisurely consumed the property in dispute,
    shut his eyes, yawned, turned upon his back, thrust out his
    legs divergently, and died.</p>

    <p>For the meat had been carefully poisoned&mdash;a fact of
    which the raven was guiltily conscious.</p>

    <h3>LXXI.</h3>

    <p>The King of Persia had a favourite hawk. One day his Majesty
    was hunting, and had become separated from his attendants.
    Feeling thirsty, he sought a stream of water trickling from a
    rock; took a cup, and pouring some liquor into it from his
    pocket-flask, filled it up with water, and raised it to his
    lips. The hawk, who had been all this time hovering about,
    swooped down, screaming "No, you don't!" and upset the cup with
    his wing.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
       id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>

    <p>"I know what is the matter," said the King: "there is a dead
    serpent in the fountain above, and this faithful bird has saved
    my life by not permitting me to drink the juice. I must reward
    him in the regular way."</p>

    <p>So he called a page, who had thoughtfully presented himself,
    and gave directions to have the Remorse Apartments of the
    palace put in order, and for the court tailor to prepare an
    evening suit of sackcloth-and-ashes. Then summoning the hawk,
    he seized and dashed him to the ground, killing him very dead.
    Rejoining his retinue, he dispatched an officer to remove the
    body of the serpent from the fountain, lest somebody else
    should get poisoned. There wasn't any serpent&mdash;the water
    was remarkable for its wholesome purity!</p>

    <p>Then the King, cheated of his remorse, was sorry he had
    slain the bird; he said it was a needless waste of power to
    kill a bird who merely deserved killing. It never occurred to
    the King that the hawk's touching solicitude was with reference
    to the contents of the royal flask.</p>

    <p>A herd of cows, blown off the summit of the Himalayas, were
    sailing some miles above the valleys, when one said to
    another:</p>

    <p>"Got anything to say about this?"</p>

    <p>"Not much," was the answer. "It's airy."</p>

    <p>"I wasn't thinking of that," continued the first; "I am
    troubled about our course. If we could leave the Pleiades a
    little more to the right, striking
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"

    <p>A bear, who had worn himself out walking from one end of his
    cage to the other, addressed his keeper thus:</p>

    <p>"I say, friend, if you don't procure me a shorter cage I
    shall have to give up zoology; it is about the most wearing
    pursuit I ever engaged in. I favour the advancement of science,
    but the mechanical part of it is a trifle severe, and ought to
    be done by contract."</p>

    <p>"You are quite right, my hearty," said the keeper, "it
    <i>is</i> severe; and there have been several excellent plans
    proposed to lighten the drudgery. Pending the adoption of some
    of them, you would find a partial relief in lying down and
    keeping quiet."</p>

    <p>"It won't do&mdash;it won't do!" replied the bear,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> with a mournful shake of the
       head, "it's not the orthodox thing. Inaction may do for
       professors, collectors, and others connected with the
       ornamental part of the noble science; but for <i>us</i>, we
       must keep moving, or zoology would soon revert to the crude
       guesses and mistaken theories of the azoic period. And yet,"
       continued the beast, after the keeper had gone, "there is
       something novel and ingenious in what the underling
       suggests. I must remember that; and when I have leisure,

    <p>A hen who had hatched out a quantity of ducklings, was
    somewhat surprised one day to see them take to the water, and
    sail away out of her jurisdiction. The more she thought of this
    the more unreasonable such conduct appeared, and the more
    indignant she became. She resolved that it must cease
    forthwith. So she soon afterward convened her brood, and
    conducted them to the margin of a hot pool, having a business
    connection with the boiling spring of Doo-sno-swair. They
    straightway launched themselves for a cruise&mdash;returning

       those who boast themselves our brothers is, possibly,
       fraternal&mdash;but it hurts."</p>

    <p>"I confess," replied the idler, "that our usages with regard
    to vermin and reptiles might be so amended as to be more
    temperately diabolical; but please to remember that the gentle
    agonies with which we afflict <i>you</i> are wholesome and
    exhilarating compared with the ills we ladle out to one
    another. During the reign of His Pellucid Refulgence, Khatchoo
    Khan," he continued, absently dropping his wriggling auditor
    into the brook, "no less than three hundred thousand Persian
    subjects were put to death, in a pleasing variety of ingenious
    ways, for their religious beliefs."</p>

    <p>"What that has to do with your treatment of <i>us</i>"
    interrupted a fish, who, having bitten at the worm just then,
    was drawn into the conversation, "I am quite unable to
    see."</p>

    <p>"That," said the angler, disengaging him, "is because you
    have the hook through your eyeball, my edible friend."</p>

    <p>Many a truth is spoken in jest; but at least ten times as
    many falsehoods are uttered in dead earnest.</p>

    <p>A wild cat was listening with rapt approval to the melody of

    <p>Presently the tuneful sounds drew near, whereupon she began

    into view below her, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"

    <p>Having been taught to turn his scraps of bad Persian into
    choice Latin, a parrot was puffed up with conceit.</p>

    <p>"Observe," said he, "the superiority I may boast by virtue
    of my classical education: I can chatter flat nonsense in the
    language of Cicero."</p>

    <p>"I would advise you," said his master, quietly, "to let it
    be of a different character from that chattered by some of Mr.
    Cicero's most admired compatriots, if you value the priviledge
    of hanging at that public window. 'Commit no mythology,'

    <p>A rat, finding a file, smelt it all over, bit it gently, and
    observed that, as it did not seem to be rich enough to produce
    dyspepsia, he would venture to make a meal of it. So he gnawed
    it into <i>smithareens</i> <a id="footnotetagD"
       name="footnotetagD"></a><a href="#footnoteD"><sup>[D]</sup></a>
       without the slightest injury to his teeth. With his morals
       the case was somewhat different. For the file was a file of
       newspapers, and his system became so saturated with the
       "spirit of the Press" that he went off and called his aged
       father a "lingering contemporary;" advised the correction of
       brief tails by amputation; lauded the skill of a quack
       rodentist for money; and, upon what would otherwise have
       been his death-bed, essayed a lie of such phenomenal
       magnitude <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> that it stuck in his throat,
       and prevented him breathing his last. All this crime, and
       misery, and other nonsense, because he was too lazy to worry
       about and find a file of nutritious fables.</p>

    <p>This tale shows the folly of eating everything you happen to
    fancy. Consider, moreover, the danger of such a course to your
    neighbour's wife.</p>

    <p>"I should like to climb up you, if you don't mind," cried an
    ivy to a young oak.</p>

    <p>"Oh, certainly; come along," was the cheerful assent.</p>

    <p>So she started up, and finding she could grow faster than
    he, she wound round and round him until she had passed up all
    the line she had. The oak, however, continued to grow, and as
    she could not disengage her coils, she was just lifted out by
    the root. So that ends the oak-and-ivy business, and removes a
    powerful temptation from the path of the young writer.</p>

    <p>A merchant of Cairo gave a grand feast. In the midst of the
    revelry, the great doors of the dining-hall were pushed open
    from the outside, and the guests were surprised and grieved by
    the advent of a crocodile of a tun's girth, and as long as the
    moral law.</p>

    <p>"Thought I 'd look in," said he, simply, but not without a
    certain grave dignity.</p>

    <p>"But," cried the host, from the top of the table, "I did not
    invite any saurians."</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;I know yer didn't; it's the old thing, it is:
    never no wacancies for saurians&mdash;saurians should orter
    keep theirselves <i>to</i> theirselves&mdash;no saurians
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"

       'eart, I tell yer. But don't give yerself no distress; I
       didn't come to beg; thank 'eaven I ain't drove to that
       yet&mdash;leastwise I ain't done it. But I thought as 'ow
       yer'd need a dish to throw slops and broken wittles in it;
       which I fetched along this 'ere."</p>

    <p>And the willing creature lifted off the cover by erecting
    the upper half of his head till the snout of him smote the
    ceiling.</p>

    <p>A gander being annoyed by the assiduous attendance of his
    ugly reflection in the water, determined that he would
    prosecute future voyages in a less susceptible element. So he
    essayed a sail upon the placid bosom of a clay-bank. This kind
    of navigation did not meet his expectations, however, and he
    returned with dogged despair to his pond, resolved to make a
    final cruise and go out of commission. He was delighted to find
    that the clay adhering to his hull so defiled the water that it
    gave back no image of him. After that, whenever he left port,
    he was careful to be well clayed along the water-line.</p>

    <p>The lesson of this is that if all geese are alike, we can
    banish unpleasant reflections by befouling ourselves. This is
    worth knowing.</p>

    <p>The belly and the members of the human body were in a riot.
    (This is not the riot recorded by an inferior writer, but a
    more notable and authentic one.) After exhausting the
    well-known arguments, they had recourse to the appropriate
    threat, when <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span> the man to whom they belonged
       thought it time for <i>him</i> to be heard, in his capacity
       as a unit.</p>

    <p>"Deuce take you!" he roared. "Things have come to a pretty
    pass if a fellow cannot walk out of a fine morning without
    alarming the town by a disgraceful squabble between his
    component parts! I am reasonably impartial, I hope, but man's
    devotion is due to his deity: I espouse the cause of my
    belly."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the members were thrown into so extraordinary
    confusion that the man was arrested for a windmill.</p>

    <h3>LXXXIII.</h3>

    <p>A man dropping from a balloon struck against a soaring
    eagle.</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon," said he, continuing his descent; "I
    never <i>could</i> keep off eagles when in my descending
    node."</p>

    <p>"It is agreeable to meet so pleasing a gentleman, even
    without previous appointment," said the bird, looking
    admiringly down upon the lessening aeronaut; "he is the very
    pink of politeness. How extremely nice his liver must be. I
    will follow him down and arrange his simple obsequies."</p>

    <p>This fable is narrated for its intrinsic worth.</p>

    <h3>LXXXIV.</h3>

    <p>To escape from a peasant who had come suddenly upon him, an
    opossum adopted his favourite expedient of counterfeiting
    death.</p>

    <p>"I suppose," said the peasant, "that ninety-nine men in a
    hundred would go away and leave this poor creature's body to
    the beasts of prey." [It is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span> notorious that man is the
       only living thing that will eat the animal.] "But <i>I</i>
       will give him good burial."</p>

    <p>So he dug a hole, and was about tumbling him into it, when a
    solemn voice appeared to emanate from the corpse: "Let the dead
    bury their dead!"</p>

    <p>"Whatever spirit hath wrought this miracle," cried the
    peasant, dropping upon his knees, "let him but add the trifling
    explanation of <i>how</i> the dead can perform this or any
    similar rite, and I am obedience itself. Otherwise, in goes Mr.
    'Possum by these hands."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" meditated the unhappy beast, "I have performed one
    miracle, but I can't keep it up all day, you know. The
    explanation demanded is a trifle too heavy for even the
    ponderous ingenuity of a marsupial."</p>

    <p>And he permitted himself to be sodded over.</p>

    <p>If the reader knows what lesson is conveyed by this

    <p>Three animals on board a sinking ship prepared to take to
    the water. It was agreed among them that the bear should be
    lowered alongside; the mouse (who was to act as pilot) should
    embark upon him at once, to beat off the drowning sailors; and
    the monkey should follow, with provisions for the
    expedition&mdash;which arrangement was successfully carried
    out. The fourth day out from the wreck, the bear began to
    propound a series of leading questions concerning dinner; when
    it appeared that the monkey had provided but a single nut.</p>

    <p>"I thought this would keep me awhile," he explained, "and
    you could eat the pilot."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the mouse vanished like a flash
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> into the bear's ear, and
       fearing the hungry beast would then demand the nut, the
       monkey hastily devoured it. Not being in a position to
       insist upon his rights, the bear merely gobbled up the
       monkey.</p>

    <p>A lamb suffering from thirst went to a brook to drink.
    Putting his nose to the water, he was interested to feel it
    bitten by a fish. Not liking fish, he drew back and sought
    another place; but his persecutor getting there before him
    administered the same rebuff. The lamb being rather
    persevering, and the fish having no appointments for that day,
    this was repeated a few thousand times, when the former felt
    justified in swearing:</p>

    <p>"I'm eternally boiled!" said he, "if ever I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> experienced so many fish in
       all my life. It is discouraging. It inspires me with mint
       sauce and green peas."</p>

    <p>He probably meant amazement and fear; under the influence of
    powerful emotions even lambs will talk "shop."</p>

    <p>"Well, good bye," said his tormentor, taking a final nip at
    the animal's muzzle; "I should like to amuse you some more; but
    I have other fish to fry."</p>

    <p>This tale teaches a good quantity of lessons; but it does
    <i>not</i> teach why this fish should have persecuted this
    lamb.</p>

    <p>A mole, in pursuing certain geological researches, came upon
    the buried carcase of a mule, and was about to tunnel him.</p>

    mining operations in a less sacrilegious direction. Respect the
    dead, as you hope for death!"</p>

    <p>"You have that about you," said the gnome, "that must make
    your grave respected in a certain sense, for at least such a
    period as your immortal part may require for perfect
    exhalation. The immunity I accord is not conceded to your
    sanctity, but extorted by your scent. The sepulchres of moles

    <p>"If you do," retorted the other, "I'll pump on you, if I can
    get any one to work my handle."</p>

    <p>Exasperated by this impotent conservative threat, she pushed
    her little dart against him with all her vigour. When she tried
    to sheathe it again she couldn't, but she still made herself
    useful about the hive by hooking on to small articles and
    dragging them about. But no other bee would sleep with her
    after this; and so, by her ill-judged resentment, she was
    self-condemmed to a solitary cell.</p>

    <p>A Chinese dog, who had been much abroad with his master, was
    asked, upon his return, to state the most ludicrous fact he had
    observed.</p>

    <p>"There is a country," said he, "the people of which are
    eternally speaking about 'Persian honesty,' 'Persian courage,'
    'Persian loyalty,' 'Persian love of fair play,' &amp;c., as if
    the Persians enjoyed a clear monopoly of these universal
    virtues. What is more, they speak thus in blind good
    faith&mdash;with a dense gravity of conviction that is simply
    amazing."</p>

    <p>"But," urged the auditors, "we requested something
    ludicrous, not amazing."</p>

    which is&mdash;"</p>

    <p>There was a calf, who, suspecting the purity of the milk
    supplied him by his dam, resolved to transfer his patronage to
    the barn-yard pump.</p>

    <p>"Better," said he, "a pure article of water, than a diet
    that is neither fish, flesh, nor
    fowl."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"

    <p>But, although extremely regular in his new diet&mdash;taking
    it all the time&mdash;he did not seem to thrive as might have
    been expected. The larger orders he drew, the thinner and the
    more transparent he became; and at last, when the shadow of his
    person had become to him a vague and unreal memory, he
    repented, and applied to be reinstated in his comfortable
    sinecure at the maternal udder.</p>

    <p>"Ah! my prodigal son," said the old lady, lowering her horns
    as if to permit him to weep upon her neck, "I regret that it is
    out of my power to celebrate your return by killing the fatted

    <p>A certain magician owned a learned pig, who had lived a
    cleanly gentlemanly life, achieving great fame, and winning the
    hearts of all the people. But perceiving he was not happy, the
    magician, by a process easily explained did space permit,
    transformed him into a man. Straightway the creature abandoned
    his cards, his timepiece, his musical instruments, and all
    other devices of his profession, and betook him to a pool of
    mud, wherein he inhumed himself to the tip of his nose.</p>

    <p>"Ten minutes ago," said the magician reprovingly, "you would
    have scorned to do an act like that."</p>

    <p>"Nature has been very kind to her creatures," said a giraffe
    to an elephant. "For example, your
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"

       has given you a proboscis wherewith to reach your food; and
       I having no proboscis, she has bestowed upon me a long
       neck."</p>

    <p>"I think, my good friend, you have been among the
    theologians," said the elephant. "I doubt if I am clever enough
    to argue with you. I can only say it does not strike me that
    way."</p>

    <p>"But, really," persisted the giraffe, "you must confess your
    trunk is a great convenience, in that it enables you to reach
    the high branches of which you are so fond, even as my long
    neck enables me."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps," mused the ungrateful pachyderm, "if we could not
    reach the higher branches, we should develop a taste for the
    lower ones."</p>

    <p>"In any case," was the rejoinder, "we can never be
    sufficiently thankful that we are unlike the lowly
    hippopotamus, who can reach neither the one nor the other."</p>

    <p>"Ah! yes," the elephant assented, "there does not seem to
    have been enough of Nature's kindness to go round."</p>

    <p>"But the hippopotamus has his roots and his rushes."</p>

    <p>"It is not easy to see how, with his present appliances, he
    could obtain anything else."</p>

    <p>This fable teaches nothing; for those who perceive the
    meaning of it either knew it before, or will not be taught.</p>

    <p>A pious heathen who was currying favour with his wooden
    deity by sitting for some years motionless in a treeless plain,
    observed a young ivy putting forth her tender shoots at his
    feet. He thought he could endure the additional martyrdom of a
    little <span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
       id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> shade, and begged her to make
       herself quite at home.</p>

    <p>"Exactly," said the plant; "it is my mission to adorn
    venerable ruins."</p>

    <p>She lapped her clinging tendrils about his wasted shanks,
    and in six months had mantled him in green.</p>

    <p>"It is now time," said the devotee, a year later, "for me to
    fulfil the remainder of my religious vow. I must put in a few
    seasons of howling and leaping. You have been very good, but I
    no longer require your gentle ministrations."</p>

    <p>"But I require yours," replied the vine; "you have become a
    second nature to me. Let others indulge in the delights of
    gymnastic worship; you and I will 'surfer and be
    strong'&mdash;respectively."</p>

    <p>A monkey finding a heap of cocoa-nuts, gnawed into one, then
    dropped it, gagging hideously.</p>

    <p>"Now, this is what <i>I</i> call perfectly disgusting!" said
    he: "I can never leave anything lying about but some one comes
    along and puts a quantity of nasty milk into it!"</p>

    <p>A cat just then happening to pass that way began rolling the
    cocoa-nuts about with her paw.</p>

    <p>"Yeow!" she exclaimed; "it is enough to vex the soul of a
    cast-iron dog! Whenever I set out any milk to cool, somebody
    comes and seals it up tight as a drum!"</p>

    <p>Then perceiving one another, and each thinking the other the
    offender, these enraged animals contended, and wrought a mutual
    extermination. Whereby two worthy consumers were lost to
    society, and a quantity of excellent food had to be given to
    the poor.</p>

    <p>A mouse who had overturned an earthern jar was discovered by

    him in the harshest and most threatening manner.</p>

    <p>"You little wretch!" said she, "how dare you knock over that
    valuable urn? If it had been filled with hot water, and I had
    been lying before it asleep, I should have been scalded to
    death."</p>

    <p>In crossing a frozen pool, a monkey slipped and fell,
    striking upon the back of his head with considerable force, so
    that the ice was very much shattered. A peacock, who was
    strutting about on shore thinking what a pretty peacock he was,
    laughed immoderately at the mishap. N.B.&mdash;All
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> laughter is immoderate when a
       fellow is hurt&mdash;if the fellow is oneself.</p>

    <p>"Bah!" exclaimed the sufferer; "if you could see the
    beautiful prismatic tints I have knocked into this ice, you
    would laugh out of the other side of your bill. The splendour
    of your tail is quite eclipsed."</p>

    <p>Thus craftily did he inveigle the vain bird, who finally
    came and spread his tail alongside the fracture for comparison.
    The gorgeous feathers at once froze fast to the ice,
    and&mdash;in short, that artless fowl passed a very
    uncomfortable winter.</p>

    <p>A volcano, having discharged a few million tons of stones
    upon a small village, asked the mayor if he thought that a
    tolerably good supply for building purposes.</p>

    <p>"I think," replied that functionary, "if you give us another
    dash of granite, and just a pinch of old red sandstone, we
    could manage with what you have already done for us. We would,
    however, be grateful for the loan of your crater to bake
    bricks."</p>

    <p>"Oh, certainly; parties served at their residences." Then,
    after the man had gone, the mountain added, with mingled lava
    and contempt: "The most insatiable people I ever contracted to
    supply. They shall not have another pebble!"</p>

    <p>He banked his fires, and in six weeks was as cold as a
    neglected pudding. Then might you have seen the heaving of the
    surface boulders, as the people began stirring forty fathoms
    beneath.</p>

    <p>"I entertain for you a sentiment of profound amity," said
    the tiger to the leopard. "And why should I not? for are we not
    members of the same great feline family?"</p>

    <p>"True," replied the leopard, who was engaged in the hopeless
    endeavour to change his spots; "since we have mutually
    plundered one another's hunting grounds of everything edible,
    there remains no grievance to quarrel about. You are a good
    fellow; let us embrace!"</p>

    <p>They did so with the utmost heartiness; which being observed
    by a contiguous monkey, that animal got up a tree, where he
    delivered himself of the wisdom following:</p>

    <p>"There is nothing so touching as these expressions of mutual
    regard between animals who are vulgarly believed to hate one
    another. They render the brief intervals of peace almost
    endurable to both parties. But the difficulty is, there are so
    many excellent reasons why these relatives should live in
    peace, that they won't have time to state them all before the

    <p>A woodpecker, who had bored a multitude of holes in the body
    of a dead tree, was asked by a robin to explain their
    purpose.</p>

    <p>"As yet, in the infancy of science," replied the woodpecker,
    "I am quite unable to do so. Some naturalists affirm that I
    hide acorns in these pits; others maintain that I get worms out
    of them. I endeavoured for some time to reconcile the two
    theories; but the worms ate my acorns, and then
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> would not come out. Since
       then, I have left science to work out its own problems,
       while I work out the holes. I hope the final decision may be
       in some way advantageous to me; for at my nest I have a
       number of prepared holes which I can hammer into some
       suitable tree at a moment's notice. Perhaps I could insert a
       few into the scientific head."</p>

    <p>"No-o-o," said the robin, reflectively, "I should think not.
    A prepared hole is an idea; I don't think it could get in."</p>

    <p>"Are you going to this great hop?" inquired a spruce cricket
    of a labouring beetle.</p>

    <p>"No," replied he, sadly, "I've got to attend this great
    ball."</p>

    <p>"Blest if I know the difference," drawled a more offensive
    insect, with his head in an empty silk hat; "and I've been in
    society all my life. But why was I not invited to either hop or
    ball?"</p>

    <p>He is now invited to the latter.</p>

    <p>"Too bad, too bad," said a young Abyssinian to a yawning
    hippopotamus.</p>

    <p>"What is 'too bad?'" inquired the quadruped. "What is the
    matter with you?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, <i>I</i> never complain," was the reply; "I was only
    thinking of the niggard economy of Nature in building a great
    big beast like you and not giving him any mouth."</p>

    <p>"H'm, h'm! it was still worse," mused the beast,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
       id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> "to construct a great wit
       like you and give him no seasonable occasion for the display

    <p>A moment later there were a cracking of bitten bones, a
    great gush of animal fluids, the vanishing of two black
    feet&mdash;in short, the fatal poisoning of an indiscreet

    <p>A salmon vainly attempted to leap up a cascade. After trying
    a few thousand times, he grew so fatigued that he began to leap
    less and think more. Suddenly an obvious method of surmounting
    the difficulty presented itself to the salmonic
    intelligence.</p>

    <p>"Strange," he soliloquized, as well as he could in the
    water,&mdash;"very strange I did not think of it before! I'll
    go above the fall and leap downwards."</p>

    <p>So he went out on the bank, walked round to the upper side
    of the fall, and found he could leap over quite easily. Ever
    afterwards when he went up-stream in the spring to be caught,
    he adopted this plan. He has been heard to remark that the
    price of salmon might be brought down to a merely nominal
    figure, if so many would not wear themselves out before getting
    up to where there is good fishing.</p>

    <p>"The son of a jackass," shrieked a haughty mare to a mule

    <p>"It is true," was the meek reply, "I cannot boast an
    illustrious ancestry; but at least I shall never be called upon
    to blush for my posterity. Yonder mule colt is as proper a
    son&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yonder mule colt?" interrupted the mare, with a look of
    ineffable contempt for her auditor; "that is <i>my</i>

    <p>"The consort of a jackass and the mother of mules," retorted
    he, quietly, "should cultivate the simple thingamy of

    that vegetable for all the world. But I never can look upon an
    apple of that variety without thinking of my poisoned nestling!
    Ah! so plump, and rosy, and&mdash;rotten!"</p>

    <p>"Just so," said the other. "And you remember
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"

       in that orchard. Strange that so fair a skin should cover so

    <p>"I am very grateful," the young man said; "but I am unable
    to comprehend how the sight of this pretty piece of painted
    confectionery should incite you all to slander your dead

    <p>"The Millennium is come," said a lion to a lamb. "Suppose
    you come out of that fold, and let us lie down together, as it
    has been foretold we should."</p>

    <p>"Been to dinner to-day?" inquired the lamb.</p>

    <p>"Not a bite of anything since breakfast," was the reply,
    "except a few lean swine, a saddle or two, and some old
    harness."</p>

    <p>"I distrust a Millennium," continued the lamb, thoughtfully,
    "which consists <i>solely</i> in our lying down together. My
    notion of that happy time is that it is a period in which pork
    and leather are not articles of diet, but in which every
    respectable lion shall have as much mutton as he can consume.
    However, you may go over to yonder sunny hill and lie down
    until I come."</p>

    <p>It is singular how a feeling of security tends to develop
    cunning. If that lamb had been out upon the open plain he would
    have readily fallen into the snare&mdash;and it was studded
    very thickly with teeth.</p>

    <p>"In whose good taste, my adipose censor?" inquired the ass,
    not too respectfully.</p>

    <p>"Why&mdash;h'm&mdash;ah! I mean it does not suit <i>me</i>.
    You ought to bellow."</p>

    <p>"May I inquire how it happens to be any of your business
    whether I bellow or bray, or do both&mdash;or neither?"</p>

    <p>"I cannot tell you," answered the critic, shaking his head
    despondingly; "I do not at all understand
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
       id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> it. I can only say that I
       have been accustomed to censure all discourse that differs
       from my own."</p>

    <p>"Exactly," said the ass; "you have sought to make an art of
    impertinence by mistaking preferences for principles. In
    'taste' you have invented a word incapable of definition, to
    denote an idea impossible of expression; and by employing in
    connection therewith the words 'good' and 'bad,' you indicate a
    merely subjective process in terms of an objective quality.
    Such presumption transcends the limit of the merely impudent,
    and passes into the boundless empyrean of pure cheek!"</p>

    <p>At the close of this remarkable harangue, the bovine critic
    was at a loss for language to express his disapproval. So he
    said the speech was in bad taste.</p>

    rookery!" said a slug, who was characteristically insinuating
    himself between the stems of the celery intended for dinner. "A
    miserable old shanty like that, without stables, grounds, or
    any modern conveniences!"</p>

    <p>"Pay!" said the snail, contemptuously; "I'd
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"

       semi-detatched villa like this at a nominal rate!"</p>

    <p>"Ah!" panted the hare; "how very fortunate! I feel quite
    safe here, for you dislike dogs quite as much as I do."</p>

    <p>"Your security, my small friend," replied the wolf, "depends
    not upon those points in which you and I agree, but upon those
    in which I and the dog differ."</p>

    <p>"Then you mean to eat me?" inquired the timorous puss.</p>

    <p>"No-o-o," drawled the wolf, reflectively, "I should not like
    to promise <i>that</i>; I mean to eat a part of you. There may
    be a tuft of fur, and a toe-nail or two, left for you to go on
    with. I am hungry, but I am not hoggish."</p>

    <p>"The distinction is too fine for me," said the hare,

    effect.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"

    <p>"Hum, hum!" he mused, with a look of disappointment, "gone
    to the sea side, I suppose."</p>

    <p>So he turned away, thinking he would call again later in the
    season; but he had not proceeded far before he conceived a
    brilliant idea. Perhaps there had been a suicide!&mdash;or a
    murder! He would go back and force the door. By way of doing so
    he obtained a large stone, and smashed in the roof. There had
    been no murder to justify such audacity, so he committed
    one.</p>

    <p>The funeral was gorgeous. There were mute oysters with
    wands, drunken oysters with scarves and hat-bands, a sable
    hearse with hearth-dusters on it, a swindling undertaker's
    bill, and all the accessories of a first-rate churchyard
    circus&mdash;everything necessary but the corpse. That had been
    disposed of by the monkey, and the undertaker meanly withheld
    the use of his own.</p>

    embarrass any bear that ever bore. I can remain passive, and

    <p>So he sat down to think it over. He considered the question
    in all its aspects, until he grew quite thin; turned it over
    and over in his mind until he was too weak to sit up; meditated
    upon it with a constantly decreasing pulse, a rapidly failing
    respiration. But he could not make up his mind, and finally

    <p>A sword-fish having penetrated seven or eight feet into the

    portion of his horn inside; but he bore it as bravely

    <p>A facetious old cat seeing her kitten sleeping in a bath
    tub, went down into the cellar and turned on the hot water.
    (For the convenience of the bathers the bath was arranged in
    that way; you had to undress, and then go down to the cellar to
    let on the wet.) No sooner did the kitten remark the unfamiliar
    sensation, than he departed thence with a willingness quite
    creditable in one who was not a professional acrobat, and met
    his mother on the kitchen stairs.</p>

    <p>"Aha! my steaming hearty!" cried the elder
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
       id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> grimalkin; "I coveted you
       when I saw the cook put you in the dinner-pot. If I have a
       weakness, it is hare&mdash;hare nicely dressed, and
       partially boiled."</p>

    <p>Whereupon she made a banquet of her suffering
    offspring.<a id="footnotetagF"

    <p>Adversity works a stupendous change in tender youth; many a
    young man is never recognized by his parents after having been
    in hot water.</p>

    <h3>CXIX.</h3>

    <p>"It is a waste of valour for us to do battle," said a lame
    ostrich to a negro who had suddenly come upon her in the
    desert; "let us cast lots to see who shall be considered the
    victor, and then go about our business."</p>

    <p>To this proposition the negro readily assented. They cast
    lots: the negro cast lots of stones, and the ostrich cast lots
    of feathers. Then the former went about his business, which
    consisted of skinning the bird.</p>

    <p>MORAL.&mdash;There is nothing like the arbitrament of
    chance. That form of it known as <i>trile-bi-joorie</i> is
    perhaps as good as any.</p>

    <h3>CXX.</h3>

    <p>An author who had wrought a book of fables (the merit
    whereof transcended expression) was peacefully sleeping atop of
    the modest eminence to which he had attained, when he was
    rudely awakened by a throng of critics, emitting adverse
    judgment upon the tales he had builded.</p>

    <p>"Apparently," said he, "I have been guilty of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> some small grains of
       unconsidered wisdom, and the same have proven a bitterness
       to these excellent folk, the which they will not abide. Ah,
       well! those who produce the Strasburg
       <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i> and the feather-pillow are prone to
       regard <i>us</i> as rival creators. I presume it is in
       course of nature for him who grows the pen to censure the
       manner of its use."</p>

    <p>So speaking, he executed a smile a hand's-breath in extent,
    and resumed his airy dream of dropping ducats.</p>

    <h3>CXXI.</h3>

    <p>For many years an opossum had anointed his tail with bear's
    oil, but it remained stubbornly bald-headed. At last his
    patience was exhausted, and he appealed to Bruin himself,
    accusing him of breaking faith, and calling him a
    quack.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>

    <p>"Why, you insolent marsupial!" retorted the bear in a rage;
    "you expect my oil to give you hair upon your tail, when it
    will not give me even a tail. Why don't you try under-draining,
    or top-dressing with light compost?"</p>

    <p>They said and did a good deal more before the opossum
    withdrew his cold and barren member from consideration; but the
    judicious fabulist does not encumber his tale with extraneous
    matter, lest it be pointless.</p>

    <h3>CXXII.</h3>

    <p>"So disreputable a lot as you are I never saw!" said a
    sleepy rat to the casks in a wine-cellar. "Always making night
    hideous with your hoops and hollows, and disfiguring the day
    with your bunged-up appearance. There is no sleeping when once
    the wine has got into your heads. I'll report you to the
    butler!"</p>

    <p>"The sneaking tale-bearer," said the casks. "Let us beat him
    with our staves."</p>

    <p>"<i>Requiescat in pace</i>," muttered a learned cobweb,
    sententiously.</p>

    <p>"Requires a cat in the place, does it?" shrieked the rat.
    "Then I'm off!"</p>

    <p>To explain all the wisdom imparted by this fable would
    require the pen of a pig, and volumes of smoke.</p>

    <h3>CXXIII.</h3>

    <p>A giraffe having trodden upon the tail of a poodle, that
    animal flew into a blind rage, and wrestled valorously with the
    invading foot.</p>

    <p>"Hullo, sonny!" said the giraffe, looking down, "what are
    you doing there?"</p>

    <p>"I am fighting!" was the proud reply; "but I don't know that
    it is any of your
    business."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>

    <p>"Oh, I have no desire to mix in," said the good-natured
    giraffe. "I never take sides in terrestrial strife. Still, as
    that is my foot, I think&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Eh!" cried the poodle, backing some distance away and
    gazing upward, shading his eyes with his paw. "You don't mean
    to say&mdash;by Jove it's a fact! Well, that beats <i>me</i>! A
    beast of such enormous length&mdash;such preposterous duration,
    as it were&mdash;I wouldn't have believed it! Of course I can't
    quarrel with a non-resident; but why don't you have a local
    agent on the ground?"</p>

    <p>The reply was probably the wisest ever made; but it has not
    descended to this generation. It had so very far to
    descend.</p>

    <h3>CXXIV.</h3>

    <p>A dog having got upon the scent of a deer which a hunter had
    been dragging home, set off with extraordinary zeal. After
    measuring off a few leagues, he paused.</p>

    <p>"My running gear is all right," said he; "but I seem to have
    lost my voice."</p>

    <p>Suddenly his ear was assailed by a succession of eager
    barks, as of another dog in pursuit of him. It then began to
    dawn upon him that he was a particularly rapid dog: instead of
    having lost his voice, his voice had lost him, and was just now
    arriving. Full of his discovery, he sought his master, and
    struck for better food and more comfortable housing.</p>

    <p>"Why, you miserable example of perverted powers!" said his
    master; "I never intended you for the chase, but for the road.
    You are to be a draught-dog&mdash;to pull baby about in a cart.
    You will perceive that speed is an objection. Sir, you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span> must be toned down; you will
       be at once assigned to a house with modern conveniences, and
       will dine at a French restaurant. If that system do not
       reduce your own, I'm an 'Ebrew Jew!"</p>

    <p>The journals next morning had racy and appetizing accounts
    of a canine suicide.</p>

    <h3>CXXV.</h3>

    <p>A gosling, who had not yet begun to blanch, was accosted by
    a chicken just out of the shell:</p>

    <p>"Whither away so fast, fair maid?" inquired the chick.</p>

    <p>"Wither away yourself," was the contemptuous reply; "you are
    already in the sere and yellow leaf; while I seem to have a
    green old age before me."</p>

    <h3>CXXVI.</h3>

    <p>A famishing traveller who had run down a salamander, made a
    fire, and laid him alive upon the hot coals to cook. Wearied
    with the pursuit which had preceded his capture, the animal at
    once composed himself, and fell into a refreshing sleep. At the
    end of a half-hour, the man, stirred him with a stick,
    remarking:</p>

    <p>"I say!&mdash;wake up and begin toasting, will you? How long
    do you mean to keep dinner waiting, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, I beg you will not wait for me," was the yawning reply.
    "If you are going to stand upon ceremony, everything will get
    cold. Besides, I have dined. I wish, by-the-way, you would put
    on some more fuel; I think we shall have snow."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the man, "the weather is like
    yourself&mdash;raw, and exasperatingly cool. Perhaps this will
    warm you." And he rolled a ponderous pine
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
       id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> log atop of that provoking
       reptile, who flattened out, and "handed in his checks."</p>

    <p>A humming-bird invited a vulture to dine with her. He
    accepted, but took the precaution to have an emetic along with
    him; and immediately after dinner, which consisted mainly of
    dew, spices, honey, and similar slops, he swallowed his
    corrective, and tumbled the distasteful viands out. He then
    went away, and made a good wholesome meal with his friend the
    ghoul. He has been heard to remark, that the taste for
    humming-bird fare is "too artificial for <i>him</i>." He says,
    a simple and natural diet, with agreeable companions, cheerful
    surroundings, and a struggling moon, is best for the health,
    and most agreeable to the normal palate.</p>

    <p>People with vitiated tastes may derive much profit from this
    opinion. <i>Crede experto.</i></p>

    <h3>CXXVIII.</h3>

    <p>A certain terrier, of a dogmatic turn, asked a kitten her
    opinion of rats, demanding a categorical answer. The opinion,
    as given, did not possess the merit of coinciding with his own;
    whereupon he fell upon the heretic and bit her&mdash;bit her
    until his teeth were much worn and her body much
    elongated&mdash;bit <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> her good! Having thus
       vindicated the correctness of his own view, he felt so
       amiable a satisfaction that he announced his willingness to
       adopt the opinion of which he had demonstrated the
       harmlessness. So he begged his enfeebled antagonist to
       re-state it, which she incautiously did. No sooner, however,
       had the superior debater heard it for the second time than
       he resumed his intolerance, and made an end of that unhappy
       cat.</p>

    <p>"Heresy," said he, wiping his mouth, "may be endured in the
    vigorous and lusty; but in a person lying at the very point of
    death such hardihood is intolerable."</p>

    <p>It is always intolerable.</p>

    <h3>CXXIX.</h3>

    <p>A tortoise and an armadillo quarrelled, and agreed to fight
    it out. Repairing to a secluded valley, they put themselves
    into hostile array.</p>

    <p>"Now come on!" shouted the tortoise, shrinking into the
    inmost recesses of his shell.</p>

    <p>"All right," shrieked the armadillo, coiling up tightly in
    his coat of mail; "I am ready for you!"</p>

    <p>And thus these heroes waged the awful fray from morn till
    dewy eve, at less than a yard's distance. There has never been
    anything like it; their endurance was something marvellous!
    During the night each combatant sneaked silently away; and the
    historian of the period obscurely alludes to the battle as "the
    naval engagement of the future."</p>

    </div>

    <p>Two hedgehogs having conceived a dislike to a hare,
    conspired for his extinction. It was agreed between them that
    the lighter and more agile of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> two should beat him up,
       surround him, run him into a ditch, and drive him upon the
       thorns of the more gouty and unwieldy conspirator. It was
       not a very hopeful scheme, but it was the best they could
       devise. There was a chance of success if the hare should
       prove willing, and, gambler-like, they decided to take that
       chance, instead of trusting to the remote certainty of their
       victim's death from natural cause. The doomed animal
       performed his part as well as could be reasonably expected
       of him: every time the enemy's flying detachment pressed him
       hard, he fled playfully toward the main body, and lightly
       vaulted over, about eight feet above the spines. And
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> this prickly blockhead had
       not the practical sagacity to get upon a wall seven feet and
       six inches high!</p>

    <p>This fable is designed to show that the most desperate
    chances are comparatively safe.</p>

    <h3>CXXXI.</h3>

    <p>A young eel inhabiting the mouth of a river in India,
    determined to travel. Being a fresh-water eel, he was somewhat
    restricted in his choice of a route, but he set out with a
    cheerful heart and very little luggage. Before he had proceeded
    very far up-stream he found the current too strong to be
    overcome without a ruinous consumption of coals. He decided to
    anchor his tail where it then was, and <i>grow</i> up. For the
    first hundred miles it was tolerably tedious work, but when he
    had learned to tame his impatience, he found this method of
    progress rather pleasant than otherwise. But when he began to
    be caught at widely separate points by the fishermen of eight
    or ten different nations, he did not think it so fine.</p>

    <p>This fable teaches that when you extend your residence you
    multiply your experiences. A local eel can know but little of
    angling.</p>

    <h3>CXXXII.</h3>

    <p>Some of the lower animals held a convention to settle for
    ever the unspeakably important question, What is Life?</p>

    <p>"Life," squeaked the poet, blinking and folding his filmy
    wings, "is&mdash;." His kind having been already very
    numerously heard from upon the subject, he was choked off.</p>

    <p>"Life," said the scientist, in a voice smothered by the
    earth he was throwing up into small hills, "is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> the harmonious action of
       heterogeneous but related faculties, operating in accordance
       with certain natural laws."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" chattered the lover, "but that thawt of thing is vewy
    gweat blith in the thothiety of one'th thweetheart." And
    curling his tail about a branch, he swung himself heavenward
    and had a spasm.</p>

    <p>"It is <i>vita</i>!" grunted the sententious scholar,
    pausing in his mastication of a Chaldaic root.</p>

    <p>"It is a thistle," brayed the warrior: "very nice thing to
    take!"</p>

    <p>"Life, my friends," croaked the philosopher from his hollow
    tree, dropping the lids over his cattish eyes, "is a disease.
    We are all symptoms."</p>

    <p>"Pooh!" ejaculated the physician, uncoiling and springing
    his rattle. "How then does it happen that when <i>we</i> remove
    the symptoms, the disease is gone?"</p>

    <p>"I would give something to know that," replied the
    philosopher, musingly; "but I suspect that in most cases the
    inflammation remains, and is intensified."</p>

    <p>Draw your own moral inference, "in your own jugs."</p>

    <h3>CXXXIII.</h3>

    <p>A heedless boy having flung a pebble in the direction of a
    basking lizard, that reptile's tail disengaged itself, and flew
    some distance away. One of the properties of a lizard's
    camp-follower is to leave the main body at the slightest
    intimation of danger.</p>

    <p>"There goes that vexatious narrative again," exclaimed the
    lizard, pettishly; "I never had such a tail in my life! Its
    restless tendency to divorce upon insufficient grounds is
    enough to harrow the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> reptilian soul! Now," he
       continued, backing up to the fugitive part, "perhaps you
       will be good enough to resume your connection with the
       parent establishment."</p>

    <p>No sooner was the splice effected, than an astronomer
    passing that way casually remarked to a friend that he had just
    sighted a comet. Supposing itself menaced, the timorous member
    again sprang away, coming down plump before the horny nose of a
    sparrow. Here its career terminated.</p>

    <p>We sometimes escape from an imaginary danger, only to find
    some real persecutor has a little bill against us.</p>

    <h3>CXXXIV.</h3>

    <p>A jackal who had pursued a deer all day with unflagging
    industry, was about to seize him, when an earthquake, which was
    doing a little civil engineering in that part of the country,
    opened a broad chasm between him and his prey.</p>

    <p>"Now, here," said he, "is a distinct interference with the
    laws of nature. But if we are to tolerate miracles, there is an
    end of all progress."</p>

    <p>So speaking, he endeavoured to cross the abyss at two jumps.
    His fate would serve the purpose of an impressive warning if it
    might be clearly ascertained; but the earth having immediately
    pinched together again, the research of the moral investigator
    is baffled.</p>

    <h3>CXXXV.</h3>

    <p>"Ah!" sighed a three-legged stool, "if I had only been a
    quadruped, I should have been happy as the day is
    long&mdash;which, on the twenty-first of June, would be
    considerable felicity for a stool."</p>

    <p>"Ha! look at me!" said a toadstool; "consider
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> my superior privation, and be
       content with your comparatively happy lot."</p>

    <p>"I don't discern," replied the first, "how the contemplation
    of unipedal misery tends to alleviate tripedal
    wretchedness."</p>

    <p>"You don't, eh!" sneered the toadstool. "You mean, do you,
    to fly in the face of all the moral and social
    philosophers?"</p>

    <p>"Not unless some benefactor of his race shall impel me."</p>

    <p>"H'm! I think Zambri the Parsee is the man for that kindly
    office, my dear."</p>

    <p>FOOL.&mdash;I have a question for you.</p>

    <p>PHILOSOPHER.&mdash;I have a number of them for myself. Do
    you happen to have heard that a fool can ask more questions in
    a breath than a philosopher can answer in a life?</p>

    <p>F.&mdash;Don't lay the flattering unction to your soul. The

    upon a single article of food.</p>

    <p>PH.&mdash;Other pocopos. Unable to obtain this, their
    natural sustenance, a great number of pocopos die annually of
    starvation. Their death leaves fewer mouths to feed, and by
    consequence their race is rapidly multiplying.</p>

    <p>DOCTOR.&mdash;Indeed! That sort of conversation commonly
    takes place between fools only.</p>

    <p>F.&mdash;The reporter had chosen to confound orthography: he
    spelt fool "phool," and physician "fysician." What the fool
    said was, therefore, preceded by "PH;" the remarks of the
    physician were indicated by the letter "F."</p>

    <p>D.&mdash;This must have been very confusing.</p>

    <h2>DIVERS TALES.</h2>

    <h3>THE GRATEFUL BEAR.</h3>

    <p>I hope all my little readers have heard the story of Mr.
    Androcles and the lion; so I will relate it as nearly as I can
    remember it, with the caution that Androcles must not be
    confounded with the lion. If I had a picture representing
    Androcles with a silk hat, and the lion with a knot in his
    tail, the two might readily be distinguished; but the artist
    says he won't make any such picture, and we must try to get on
    without.</p>

    <p>One day Androcles was gathering truffles in a forest, when
    he found a lion's den; and, walking into it, he lay down and
    slept. It was a custom, in his time, to sleep in lions' dens
    when practicable. The lion was absent, inspecting a zoological
    garden, and did not return until late; but he did return. He
    was surprised to find a stranger in his menagerie without a
    ticket; but, supposing him to be some contributor to a comic
    paper, did not eat him: he was very well satisfied not to be
    eaten by him. Presently Androcles awoke, wishing he had some
    seltzer water, or something. (Seltzer water is good after a
    night's debauch, and something&mdash;it is difficult to say
    what&mdash;is good to begin the new debauch with). Seeing the
    lion eyeing him, he began hastily to pencil his last will and
    testament upon the rocky
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span> floor of the den. What was
       his surprise to see the lion advance amicably and extend his
       right forefoot! Androcles, however, was equal to the
       occasion: he met the friendly overture with a cordial grasp
       of the hand, whereat the lion howled&mdash;for he had a
       carpet-tack in his foot. Perceiving that he had made a
       little mistake, Androcles made such reparation as was in his
       power by pulling out the tack and putting it in his own
       foot.</p>

    <p>After this the beast could not do too much for him. He went
    out every morning&mdash;carefully locking the door behind
    him&mdash;and returned every evening, bringing in a nice fat
    baby from an adjacent village, and laying it gratefully at his
    benefactor's feet. For the first few days something seemed to
    have gone wrong with the benefactor's appetite, but presently
    he took very kindly to the new diet; and, as he could not get
    away, he lodged there, rent-free, all the days of his
    life&mdash;which terminated very abruptly one evening when the
    lion had not met with his usual success in hunting.</p>

    <p>All this has very little to do with my story: I throw it in
    as a classical allusion, to meet the demands of a literary
    fashion which has its origin in the generous eagerness of
    writers to give the public more than it pays for. But the story
    of Androcles was a favourite with the bear whose adventures I
    am about to relate.</p>

    <p>One day this crafty brute carefully inserted a thorn between
    two of his toes, and limped awkwardly to the farm-house of Dame
    Pinworthy, a widow, who with two beautiful whelps infested the
    forest where he resided. He knocked at the open door, sent in
    his card, and was duly admitted to the presence of the lady,
    who inquired his purpose. By way of "defining his position" he
    held up his foot, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
       id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> and snuffled very
       dolorously. The lady adjusted her spectacles, took the paw
       in her lap (she, too, had heard the tale of Androcles), and,
       after a close scrutiny,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
       id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span> discovered the thorn,
       which, as delicately as possible, she extracted, the patient
       making wry faces and howling dismally the while.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/110.jpg"><img width="439"
             src="images/110.jpg"
             alt="Widow and Bear" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>When it was all over, and she had assured him there was no
    charge, his gratitude was a passion to observe! He desired to
    embrace her at once; but this, although a widow of seven years'
    standing, she would by no means permit; she said she was not
    personally averse to hugging, "but what would her dear
    departed&mdash;boo-hoo!&mdash;say of it?" This was very absurd,
    for Mr. Boo-hoo had seven feet of solid earth above him, and it
    couldn't make much difference what he said, even supposing he
    had enough tongue left to say anything, which he had not.
    However, the polite beast respected her scruples; so the only
    way in which he could testify his gratitude was by remaining to
    dinner. They had the housedog for dinner that day, though, from
    some false notion of hospitable etiquette, the woman and
    children did not take any.</p>

    <p>On the next day, punctually at the same hour, the bear came
    again with another thorn, and stayed to dinner as before. It
    was not much of a dinner this time&mdash;only the cat, and a
    roll of stair-carpet, with one or two pieces of sheet music;
    but true gratitude does not despise even the humblest means of
    expression. The succeeding day he came as before; but after
    being relieved of his torment, he found nothing prepared for
    him. But when he took to thoughtfully licking one of the little
    girl's hands, "that answered not with a caress," the mother
    thought better of it, and drove in a small heifer.</p>

    <p>He now came every day; he was so old a friend that the
    formality of extracting the thorn was no longer observed; it
    would have contributed nothing to the good understanding that
    existed between <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
       id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> him and the widow. He
       thought that three or four instances of Good Samaritanism
       afforded ample matter for perpetual gratitude. His constant
       visits were bad for the live stock of the farm; for some
       kind of beast had to be in readiness each day to furnish
       forth the usual feast, and this prevented multiplication.
       Most of the textile fabrics, too, had disappeared; for the
       appetite of this animal was at the same time cosmopolitan
       and exacting: it would accept almost anything in the way of
       <i>entremets</i>, but something it would have. A hearthrug,
       a hall-mat, a cushion, mattress, blanket, shawl, or other
       article of wearing apparel&mdash;anything, in short, that
       was easy of ingestion was graciously approved. The widow
       tried him once with a box of coals as dessert to some
       barn-yard fowls; but this he seemed to regard as a doubtful
       comestible, seductive to the palate, but obstinate in the
       stomach. A look at one of the children always brought him
       something else, no matter what he was then engaged on.</p>

    <p>It was suggested to Mrs. Pinworthy that she should poison
    the bear; but, after trying about a hundredweight of strychnia,
    arsenic, and Prussic acid, without any effect other than what
    might be expected from mild tonics, she thought it would not be
    right to go into toxicology. So the poor Widow Pinworthy went
    on, patiently enduring the consumption of her cattle, sheep,
    and hogs, the evaporation of her poultry, and the taking off of
    her bed linen, until there were left only the clothing of
    herself and children, some curtains, a sickly lamb, and a pet
    pigeon. When the bear came for these she ventured to
    expostulate. In this she was perfectly successful: the animal
    permitted her to expostulate as long as she liked. Then he ate
    the lamb and pigeon, took in a dish-cloth or two, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> went away just as
       contentedly as if she had not uttered a word.</p>

    <p>Nothing edible now stood between her little daughters and
    the grave. Her mental agony was painful to her mind; she could
    scarcely have suffered more without an increase of unhappiness.
    She was roused to desperation; and next day, when she saw the
    bear leaping across the fields toward the house, she staggered
    from her seat and shut the door. It was singular what a
    difference it made; she always remembered it after that, and
    wished she had thought of it before.</p>

    <h3>FEODORA.</h3>

    <p>Madame Yonsmit was a decayed gentlewoman who carried on her
    decomposition in a modest wayside cottage in Thuringia. She was
    an excellent sample of the Thuringian widow, a species not yet
    extinct, but trying very hard to become so. The same may be
    said of the whole genus. Madame Yonsmit was quite young, very
    comely, cultivated, gracious, and pleasing. Her home was a nest
    of domestic virtues, but she had a daughter who reflected but
    little credit upon the nest. Feodora was indeed a "bad
    egg"&mdash;a very wicked and ungrateful
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> egg. You could see she was
       by her face. The girl had the most vicious
       countenance&mdash;it was repulsive! It was a face in which
       boldness struggled for the supremacy with cunning, and both
       were thrashed into subjection by avarice. It was this latter
       virtue in Feodora which kept her mother from having a
       taxable income.</p>

    <p>Feodora's business was to beg on the highway. It wrung the
    heart of the honest amiable gentlewoman to have her daughter do
    this; but the h.a.g. having been reared in luxury, considered
    labour degrading&mdash;which it is&mdash;and there was not much
    to steal in that part of Thuringia. Feodora's mendicity would
    have provided an ample fund for their support, but unhappily
    that ingrate would hardly ever fetch home more than two or
    three shillings at a time. Goodness knows what she did with the
    rest.</p>

    <p>Vainly the good woman pointed out the sin of coveteousness;
    vainly she would stand at the cottage door awaiting the child's
    return, and begin arguing the point with her the moment she
    came in sight: the receipts diminished daily until the average
    was less than tenpence&mdash;a sum upon which no born
    gentlewoman would deign to exist. So it became a matter of some
    importance to know where Feodora kept her banking account.
    Madame Yonsmit thought at first she would follow her and see;
    but although the good lady was as vigorous and sprightly as
    ever, carrying a crutch more for ornament than use, she
    abandoned this plan because it did not seem suitable to the
    dignity of a decayed gentlewoman. She employed a detective.</p>

    <p>The foregoing particulars I have from Madame Yonsmit
    herself; for those immediately subjoining I am indebted to the
    detective, a skilful officer named
    Bowstr.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
       id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/116.jpg"><img width="500"
             src="images/116.jpg"
             alt="Feodora and Madame Yonsmit" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>No sooner had the scraggy old hag communicated her
    suspicions than the officer knew exactly what to do. He first
    distributed hand-bills all over the country, stating that a
    certain person suspected of concealing money had better look
    sharp. He then went to the Home Secretary, and by not seeking
    to understate the real difficulties of the case, induced that
    functionary to offer a reward of a thousand pounds for the
    arrest of the malefactor. Next he proceeded to a distant town,
    and took into custody a clergyman who resembled Feodora in
    respect of wearing shoes. After these formal preliminaries he
    took up the case with some zeal. He was not at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> all actuated by a desire to
       obtain the reward, but by pure love of justice. The thought
       of securing the girl's private hoard for himself never for a
       moment entered his head.</p>

    <p>He began to make frequent calls at the widow's cottage when
    Feodora was at home, when, by apparently careless conversation,
    he would endeavour to draw her out; but he was commonly
    frustrated by her old beast of a mother, who, when the girl's
    answers did not suit, would beat her unmercifully. So he took
    to meeting Feodora on the highway, and giving her coppers
    carefully marked. For months he kept this up with wonderful
    self-sacrifice&mdash;the girl being a mere uninteresting angel.
    He met her daily in the roads and forest. His patience never
    wearied, his vigilance never flagged. Her most careless glances
    were conscientiously noted, her lightest words treasured up in
    his memory. Meanwhile (the clergyman having been unjustly
    acquitted) he arrested everybody he could get his hands on.
    Matters went on in this way until it was time for the grand
    <i>coup</i>.</p>

    <p>The succeeding-particulars I have from the lips of Feodora
    herself.</p>

    <p>When that horrid Bowstr first came to the house Feodora
    thought he was rather impudent, but said, little about it to
    her mother&mdash;not desiring to have her back broken. She
    merely avoided him as much as she dared, he was so frightfully
    ugly. But she managed to endure him until he took to waylaying
    her on the highway, hanging about her all day, interfering with
    the customers, and walking home with her at night. Then her
    dislike deepened into disgust; and but for apprehensions not
    wholly unconnected with a certain crutch, she would have sent
    him about his business in short order. More than
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
       id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> a thousand million times
       she told him to be off and leave her alone, but men are such
       fools&mdash;particularly this one.</p>

    <p>What made Bowstr exceptionally disagreeable was his
    shameless habit of making fun of Feodora's mother, whom he
    declared crazy as a loon. But the maiden bore everything as
    well as she could, until one day the nasty thing put his arm
    about her waist and kissed her before her very face;
    <i>then</i> she felt&mdash;well, it is not clear how she felt,
    but of one thing she was quite sure: after having such a shame
    put upon her by this insolent brute, she would never go back
    under her dear mother's roof&mdash;never. She was too proud for
    <i>that</i>, at any rate. So she ran away with Mr. Bowstr, and
    married him.</p>

    <p>The conclusion of this history I learned for myself.</p>

    <p>Upon hearing of her daughter's desertion Madame Yonsmit went
    clean daft. She vowed she could bear betrayal, could endure
    decay, could stand being a widow, would not repine at being
    left alone in her old age (whenever she should become old), and
    could patiently submit to the sharper than a serpent's thanks
    of having a toothless child generally. But to be a
    mother-in-law! No, no; that was a plane of degradation to which
    she positively would <i>not</i> descend. So she employed me to
    cut her throat. It was the toughest throat I ever cut in all my
    life.</p>

    <h3>CONVERTING A PRODIGAL.</h3>

    <p>Little Johnny was a saving youth&mdash;one who from early
    infancy had cultivated a provident habit. When other little
    boys were wasting their substance in riotous gingerbread and
    molasses candy, investing in missionary enterprises which paid
    no dividends, subscribing to the North Labrador Orphan Fund,
    and sending capital out of the country gene rally, Johnny would
    be sticking sixpences into the chimney-pot of a big tin house
    with "BANK" painted on it in red letters above an illusory
    door. Or he would put out odd pennies at appalling rates of
    interest, with his parents, and bank the income. He was never
    weary of dropping coppers into that insatiable chimney-pot, and
    leaving them there. In this latter respect he differed notably
    from his elder brother, Charlie; for, although Charles was fond
    of banking too, he was addicted to such frequent runs upon the
    institution with a hatchet, that it kept his parents honourably
    poor to purchase banks for him; so they were reluctantly
    compelled to discourage the depositing element in his panicky
    nature.</p>

    <p>Johnny was not above work, either; to him "the dignity of
    labour" was not a juiceless platitude, as it is to me, but a
    living, nourishing truth, as satisfying and wholesome as that
    two sides of a triangle are equal to one side of bacon. He
    would hold horses for gentlemen who desired to step into a bar
    to inquire for letters. He would pursue the fleeting pig at the
    behest of a drover. He would carry water to the lions of a
    travelling menagerie, or do anything, for gain. He was
    sharp-witted too: before conveying a drop of comfort to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
       id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> parching king of beasts, he
       would stipulate for six-pence instead of the usual free
       ticket&mdash;or "tasting order," so to speak. He cared not a
       button for the show.</p>

    <p>The first hard work Johnny did of a morning was to look over
    the house for fugitive pins, needles, hair-pins, matches, and
    other unconsidered trifles; and if he sometimes found these
    where nobody had lost them, he made such reparation as was in
    his power by losing them again where nobody but he could find
    them. In the course of time, when he had garnered a good many,
    he would "realize," and bank the proceeds.</p>

    <p>Nor was he weakly superstitious, this Johnny. You could not
    fool <i>him</i> with the Santa Claus hoax on Christmas Eve: he
    would lie awake all night, as sceptical as a priest; and along
    toward morning, getting quietly out of bed, would examine the
    pendent stockings of the other children, to satisfy himself the
    predicted presents were not there; and in the morning it always
    turned out that they were not. Then, when the other children
    cried because they did not get anything, and the parents
    affected surprise (as if they really believed in the venerable
    fiction), Johnny was too manly to utter a whimper: he would
    simply slip out of the back door, and engage in traffic with
    affluent orphans; disposing of woolly horses, tin whistles,
    marbles, tops, dolls, and sugar archangels, at a ruinous
    discount for cash. He continued these provident courses for
    nine long years, always banking his accretions with scrupulous
    care. Everybody predicted he would one day be a merchant prince
    or a railway king; and some added he would sell his crown to
    the junk-dealers.</p>

    <p>His unthrifty brother, meanwhile, kept growing worse and
    worse. He was so careless of wealth&mdash;so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
       id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> so wastefully extravagant
       of lucre&mdash;that Johnny felt it his duty at times to
       clandestinely assume control of the fraternal finances, lest
       the habit of squandering should wreck the fraternal moral
       sense. It was plain that Charles had entered upon the broad
       road which leads from the cradle to the workhouse&mdash;and
       that he rather liked the travelling. So profuse was his
       prodigality that there were grave suspicions as to his
       method of acquiring what he so openly disbursed. There was
       but one opinion as to the melancholy termination of his
       career&mdash;a termination which he seemed to regard as
       eminently desirable. But one day, when the good pastor put
       it at him in so many words, Charles gave token of some
       apprehension.</p>

    <p>"Do you really think so, sir?" said he, thoughtfully; "ain't
    you playin' it on me?"</p>

    <p>"I assure you, Charles," said the good man, catching a ray
    of hope from the boy's dawning seriousness, "you will certainly
    end your days in a workhouse, unless you speedily abandon your
    course of extravagance. There is nothing like
    habit&mdash;nothing!"</p>

    <p>Charles may have thought that, considering his frequent and
    lavish contributions to the missionary fund, the parson was
    rather hard upon him; but he did not say so. He went away in
    mournful silence, and began pelting a blind beggar with
    coppers.</p>

    <p>One day, when Johnny had been more than usually provident,
    and Charles proportionately prodigal, their father, having
    exhausted moral suasion to no apparent purpose, determined to
    have recourse to a lower order of argument: he would try to win
    Charles to economy by an appeal to his grosser nature. So he
    convened the entire family, and,</p>

    <p>"Johnny," said he, "do you think you have much
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
       id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> money in your bank? You
       ought to have saved a considerable sum in nine years."</p>

    <p>Johnny took the alarm in a minute: perhaps there was some
    barefooted little girl to be endowed with Sunday-school
    books.</p>

    <p>"No," he answered, reflectively, "I don't think there can be
    much. There's been a good deal of cold weather this winter, and
    you know how metal shrinks! No-o-o, I'm sure there can't be
    only a little."</p>

    <p>"Well, Johnny, you go up and bring down your bank. We'll
    see. Perhaps Charles may be right, after all; and it's not
    worth while to save money. I don't want a son of mine to get
    into a bad habit unless it pays."</p>

    <p>So Johnny travelled reluctantly up to his garret, and went
    to the corner where his big tin bank-box had sat on a chest
    undisturbed for years. He had long ago fortified himself
    against temptation by vowing never to even shake it; for he
    remembered that formerly when Charles used to shake his, and
    rattle the coins inside, he always ended by smashing in the
    roof. Johnny approached his bank, and taking hold of the
    cornice on either side, braced himself, gave a strong lift
    upwards, and keeled over upon his back with the edifice atop of
    him, like one of the figures in a picture of the great Lisbon
    earthquake! There was but a single coin in it; and that, by an
    ingenious device, was suspended in the centre, so that every
    piece popped in at the chimney would clink upon it in passing
    through Charlie's little hole into Charlie's little stocking
    hanging innocently beneath.</p>

    <p>Of course restitution was out of the question; and even
    Johnny felt that any merely temporal punishment would be weakly
    inadequate to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> demands of justice. But
       that night, in the dead silence of his chamber, Johnny
       registered a great and solemn swear that so soon as he could
       worry together a little capital, he would fling his feeble
       remaining energies into the spendthrift business. And he did
       so.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>FOUR JACKS AND A KNAVE.</h3>

    <p>In the "backwoods" of Pennsylvania stood a little mill. The
    miller appertaining unto this mill was a Pennsylvania
    Dutchman&mdash;a species of animal in which for some centuries
    <i>sauerkraut</i> has been usurping the place of sense. In Hans
    Donnerspiel the usurpation was not complete; he still knew
    enough to go in when it rained, but he did not know enough to
    stay there after the storm had blown over. Hans was known to a
    large circle of friends and admirers as about the worst miller
    in those parts; but as he was the only one, people who
    quarrelled with an exclusively meat diet continued to patronize
    him. He was honest, as all stupid people are; but he was
    careless. So absent-minded was he, that sometimes when grinding
    somebody's wheat he would thoughtlessly turn into the "hopper"
    a bag of rye, a lot of old beer-bottles, or a basket of fish.
    This made the flour so peculiar, that the people about there
    never knew what it was to be well a day in all their lives.
    There were so many local diseases in that vicinity, that a
    doctor from twenty miles away could not have killed a patient
    in a week.</p>

    <p>Hans meant well; but he had a hobby&mdash;a hobby that he
    did not ride: that does not express it: it rode him. It spurred
    him so hard, that the poor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> wretch could not pause a
       minute to see what he was putting into his mill. This hobby
       was the purchase of jackasses. He expended all his income in
       this diversion, and his mill was fairly sinking under its
       weight of mortgages. He had more jackasses than he had hairs
       on his head, and, as a rule, they were thinner. He was no
       mere amateur collector either, but a sharp discriminating
       <i>connoisseur</i>. He would buy a fat globular donkey if he
       could not do better; but a lank shabby one was the apple of
       his eye. He rolled such a one, as it were, like a sweet
       morsel under his tongue.</p>

    <p>Hans's nearest neighbour was a worthless young scamp named
    Jo Garvey, who lived mainly by hunting and fishing. Jo was a
    sharp-witted rascal, without a single scruple between, himself
    and fortune. With a tithe of Hans's industry he might have been
    almost anything; but his dense laziness always rose up like a
    stone wall about him, shutting him in like a toad in a rock.
    The exact opposite of Hans in almost every respect, he was
    notably similar in one: he had a hobby. Jo's hobby was the
    selling of jackasses.</p>

    <p>One day, while Hans's upper and nether mill-stones were
    making it lively for a mingled grist of corn, potatoes, and
    young chickens, he heard Joseph calling outside. Stepping to
    the door, he saw him holding three halters to which were
    appended three donkeys.</p>

    <p>"I say, Hans," said he, "here are three fine animals for
    your stud. I have brought 'em up from the egg, and I know 'em
    to be first-class. But they 're not so big as I expected, and
    you may have 'em for a sack of oats each."</p>

    <p>Hans was delighted. He had not the least doubt in the world
    that Joe had stolen them; but it was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
       id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span> a fixed principle with him
       never to let a donkey go away and say he was a hard man to
       deal with. He at once brought out and delivered the oats. Jo
       gravely examined the quality, and placing a sack across each
       animal, calmly led them away.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/128.jpg"><img width="462"
             src="images/128.jpg"
             alt="Hans, Joseph and Three Asses" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>When he had gone, it occurred to Hans that he had less oats
    and no more asses than he had before.</p>

    <p>"Tuyfel!" he exclaimed, scratching his pow; "I puy dot
    yackasses, und I don't vos god 'im so mooch as I didn't haf 'im
    before&mdash;ain't it?"</p>
    <hr />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
       id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>

    <p>Very much to his comfort it was, therefore, to see Jo come
    by next day leading the same animals.</p>

    <p>"Hi!" he shrieked; "you prings me to my yackasses. You gif
    me to my broberdy back!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, very well, Hans. If you want to crawfish out of a fair
    bargain, all right. I'll give you back your donkeys, and you
    give me back my oats."</p>

    <p>"Yaw, yaw," assented the mollified miller; "you his von
    honest shentlemans as I vos efer vent anyvhere. But I don't god
    ony more oats, und you moost dake vheat, eh?"</p>

    <p>And fetching out three sacks of wheat, he handed them over.
    Jo was proceeding to lay these upon the backs of the animals;
    but this was too thin for even Hans.</p>

    <p>"Ach! you tief-veller! you leabs dis yackasses in me, und go
    right avay off; odther I bust your het mid a gloob, don't
    it?"</p>

    <p>So Joseph was reluctantly constrained to hang the donkeys to
    a fence. While he did this, Hans was making a desperate attempt
    to think. Presently he brightened up:</p>

    <p>"Yo, how you coom by dot vheat all de dime?"</p>

    <p>"Why, old mudhead, you gave it to me for the jacks."</p>

    <p>"Und how you coom by dot oats pooty soon avhile ago?"</p>

    <p>"Why, I gave that to you for them," said Joseph, pressed
    very hard for a reply.</p>

    <p>"Vell, den, you goes vetch me back to dot oats so gwicker as
    a lamb gedwinkle his dail&mdash;hay?"</p>

    <p>"All right, Hans. Lend me the donkeys to carry off my wheat,
    and I 'll bring back your oats on 'em."</p>

    <p>Joseph was beginning to despair; but no
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
       id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> objection being made, he
       loaded up the grain, and made off with his docile caravan.
       In a half-hour he returned with the donkeys, but of course
       without anything else.</p>

    <p>"I zay, Yo, where is dis oats I hear zo mooch dalk aboud
    still?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, curse you and your oats!" growled Jo, with simulated
    anger. "You make such a fuss about a bargain, I have decided
    not to trade. Take your old donkeys, and call it square!"</p>

    <p>"Den vhere mine vheat is?"</p>

    <p>"Now look here, Hans; that wheat is yours, is it?"</p>

    <p>"Yaw, yaw."</p>

    <p>"And the donkeys are yours, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Yaw, yaw."</p>

    <p>"And the wheat's been yours all the time, has it?"</p>

    <p>"Yaw, yaw."</p>

    <p>"Well, so have the donkeys. I took 'em out of your pasture
    in the first place. Now what have you got to complain of?"</p>

    <p>The Dutchman reflected all over his head with' his
    forefinger-nail.</p>

    <p>"Gomblain? I no gomblain ven it is all right. I zee now I
    vos made a mistaken. Coom, dake a drinks."</p>

    <p>Jo left the animals standing, and went inside, where they
    pledged one another in brimming mugs of beer. Then taking Hans
    by the hand,</p>

    <p>"I am sorry," said he, "we can't trade. Perhaps some other
    day you will be more reasonable. Good bye!"</p>

    <p>And Joseph departed leading away the donkeys!</p>

    <p>Hans stood for some moments gazing after him with a
    complacent smile making his fat face ridiculous.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
       id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> Then turning to his
       mill-stones, he shook his head with an air of intense
       self-satisfaction:</p>

    <p>"Py donner! Dot Yo Garfey bees a geen, shmard yockey, but he
    gonnot spiel me svoppin' yackasses!"</p>

    <h3>DR. DEADWOOD, I PRESUME.</h3>

    <p>My name is Shandy, and this is the record of my Sentimental
    Journey. Mr. Ames Jordan Gannett, proprietor's son of the "York
    &mdash;&mdash;," with which paper I am connected by marriage,
    sent me a post-card in a sealed envelope, asking me to call at
    a well-known restaurant in Regent Street. I was then at a
    well-known restaurant in Houndsditch. I put on my worst and
    only hat, and went. I found Mr. Gannett, at dinner, eating
    pease with his knife, in the manner of his countrymen. He
    opened the conversation, characteristically, thus:</p>

    <p>"Where's Dr. Deadwood?"</p>

    <p>After several ineffectual guesses I had a happy thought. I
    asked him:</p>

    <p>"Am I my brother's bar-keeper?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Gannett pondered deeply, with his forefinger alongside
    his nose. Finally he replied:</p>

    <p>"I give it up."</p>

    <p>He continued to eat for some moments in profound silence, as
    that of a man very much in earnest. Suddenly he resumed:</p>

    <p>"Here is a blank cheque, signed. I will send you all my
    father's personal property to-morrow. Take this and find Dr.
    Deadwood. Find him actually if you can, but find him.
    Away!"</p>

    <p>I did as requested; that is, I took the cheque. Having
    supplied myself with such luxuries as were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"
       id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> absolutely necessary, I
       retired to my lodgings. Upon my table in the centre of the
       room were spread some clean white sheets of foolscap, and
       sat a bottle of black ink. It was a good omen: the virgin
       paper was typical of the unexplored interior of Africa; the
       sable ink represented the night of barbarism, or the hue of
       barbarians, indifferently.</p>

    <p>Now began the most arduous undertaking mentioned in the
    "York &mdash;&mdash;," I mean in history. Lighting my pipe, and
    fixing my eye upon the ink and paper, I put my hands behind my
    back and took my departure from the hearthrug toward the
    Interior. Language fails me; I throw myself upon the reader's
    imagination. Before I had taken two steps, my vision alighted
    upon the circular of a quack physician, which I had brought
    home the day before around a bottle of hair-wash. I now saw the
    words, "Twenty-one fevers!" This prostrated me for I know not
    how long. Recovering, I took a step forward, when my eyes
    fastened themselves upon my pen-wiper, worked into the
    similitude of a tiger. This compelled me to retreat to the
    hearthrug for reinforcements. The red-and-white dog displayed
    upon that article turned a deaf ear to my entreaties; nothing
    would move him.</p>

    <p>A torrent of rain now began falling outside, and I knew the
    roads were impassable; but, chafing with impatience, I resolved
    upon another advance. Cautiously proceeding <i>vi&acirc;</i>
    the sofa, my attention fell upon a scrap of newspaper; and, to
    my unspeakable disappointment, I read:</p>

    <p>"The various tribes of the Interior are engaged in a bitter
    warfare."</p>

    <p>It may have related to America, but I could not afford to
    hazard all upon a guess. I made a wide <i>d&eacute;tour</i> by
    way of the coal-scuttle, and skirted painfully
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
       id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> along the sideboard. All
       this consumed so much time that my pipe expired in gloom,
       and I went back to the hearthrug to get a match off the
       chimney-piece. Having done so, I stepped over to the table
       and sat down, taking up the pen and spreading the paper
       between myself and the ink-bottle. It was late, and
       something must be done. Writing the familiar word
       Ujijijijijiji, I caught a neighbourly cockroach, skewered
       him upon a pin, and fastened him in the centre of the word.
       At this supreme moment I felt inclined to fall upon his neck
       and devour him with kisses; but knowing by experience that
       cockroaches are not good to eat, I restrained my feelings.
       Lifting my hat, I said:</p>

    <p>"Dr. Deadwood, I presume?"</p>

    <p><i>He did not deny it!</i></p>

    <p>Seeing he was feeling sick, I gave him a bit of cheese and
    cheered him up a trifle. After he was well restored,</p>

    <p>"Tell me," said I, "is it true that the Regent's Canal falls
    into Lake Michigan, thence running uphill to Omaha, as related
    by Ptolemy, thence spirally to Melbourne, where it joins the
    delta of the Ganges and becomes an affluent of the Albert
    Nicaragua, as Herodotus maintains?"</p>

    <p>HE DID NOT DENY IT!</p>

    <p>The rest is known to the public.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>NUT-CRACKING.</h3>

    <p>In the city of Algammon resided the Prince Champou, who was
    madly enamoured of the Lady Capilla. She returned his
    affection&mdash;unopened.</p>

    <p>In the matter of back-hair the Lady Capilla was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
       id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> blessed even beyond her
       deserts. Her natural pigtail was so intolerably long that
       she employed two pages to look after it when she walked out;
       the one a few yards behind her, the other at the extreme end
       of the line. Their names were Dan and Beersheba,
       respectively.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/134.jpg"><img width="408"
             src="images/134.jpg"
             alt="Prince Champou and Lady Capilla" /></a>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"
       id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>

    <p>Aside from salaries to these dependents, and quite apart
    from the consideration of macassar, the possession of all this
    animal filament was financially unprofitable: the hair market
    was buoyant, and hers represented a large amount of idle
    capital. And it was otherwise a source of annoyance and
    irritation; for all the young men of the city were hotly in
    love with her, and skirmishing for a love-lock. They seldom
    troubled Dan much, but the outlying Beersheba had an animated
    time of it. He was subject to constant incursions, and was
    always in a riot.</p>

    <p>The picture I have drawn to illustrate this history shows
    nothing of all these squabbles. My pen revels in the battle's
    din, but my peaceful pencil loves to depict the scenes I know
    something about.</p>

    <p>Although the Lady Capilla was unwilling to reciprocate the
    passion of Champou the man, she was not averse to quiet
    interviews with Champou the Prince. In the course of one of
    these (see my picture), as she sat listening to his
    carefully-rehearsed and really artistic avowals, with her tail
    hanging out of the window, she suddenly interrupted him:</p>

    <p>"My dear Prince," said she, "it is all nonsense, you know,
    to ask for my heart; but I am not mean; you shall have a lock
    of my hair."</p>

    <p>"Do you think," replied the Prince, "that I could be so
    sordid as to accept a single jewel from that glorious crown? I
    love this hair of yours very dearly, I admit, but only because
    of its connection with your divine head. Sever that connection,
    and I should value it no more than I would a tail plucked from
    its native cow."</p>

    <p>This comparison seems to me a very fine one, but tastes
    differ, and to the Lady Capilla it seemed quite the reverse.
    Rising indignantly, she marched away, her queue running in
    through the window <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
       id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span> and gradually tapering off
       the interview, as it were. Prince Champou saw that he had
       missed his opportunity, and resolved to repair his error.
       Straightway he forged an order on Beersheba for thirty yards
       of love-lock. To serve this writ he sent his business
       partner; for the Prince was wont to beguile his dragging
       leisure by tonsorial diversions in an obscure quarter of the
       town. At first Beersheba was sceptical, but when he saw the
       writing in real ink, his scruples vanished, and he chopped
       off the amount of souvenir demanded.</p>

    <p>Now Champou's partner was the Court barber, and by the use
    of a peculiar hair oil which the two of them had concocted,
    they soon managed to balden the pates of all the male
    aristocracy of the place. Then, to supply the demand so
    created, they devised beautiful wigs from the Lady Capilla's
    lost tresses, which they sold at a marvellous profit. And so
    they were enabled to retire from this narrative with good
    incomes.</p>

    <p>It was known that the Lady Capilla, who, since the alleged
    murder of one Beersheba, had shut herself up like a hermit, or
    a jack-knife, would re-enter society; and a great ball was
    given to do her honour. The feauty, bank, and rashion of
    Algammon had assembled in the Guildhall for that purpose. While
    the revelry was at its fiercest, the dancing at its loosest,
    the rooms at their hottest, and the perspiration at
    spring-tide, there was a sound of wheels outside, begetting an
    instant hush of expectation within. The dancers ceased to spin,
    and all the gentlemen crowded about the door. As the Lady
    Capilla entered, these instinctively fell into two lines, and
    she passed down the space between, with her little tail behind
    her. As the end of the latter came into the room, the wigs of
    the two gentlemen <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
       id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> nearest the door leaped off
       to join their parent stem. In their haste to recover them
       the two gentlemen bent eagerly forward, knocking their
       shining pows together with a vehemence that shattered them
       like egg-shells. The wigs of the next pair were similarly
       affected; and in seeking to recover them the pair similarly
       perished. Then, <i>crack! spat! pash!</i>&mdash;at every
       step the lady took there were two heads that beat as one. In
       three minutes there was but a single living male in the
       room. He was an odd one, who, having a lady opposite him,
       had merely pitched himself headlong into her stomach,
       doubling her like a lemon-squeezer.</p>

    <p>It was merry to see the Lady Capilla floating through the
    mazy dance that night, with all those wigs fighting for their
    old places in her pigtail.</p>

    <h3>THE MAGICIAN'S LITTLE JOKE.</h3>

    <p>About the middle of the fifteenth century there dwelt in the
    Black Forest a pretty but unfashionable young maiden named
    Simprella Whiskiblote. The first of these names was hers in
    monopoly; the other she enjoyed in common with her father.
    Simprella was the most beautiful fifteenth-century girl I ever
    saw. She had coloured eyes, a complexion, some hair, and two
    lips very nearly alike, which partially covered a lot of teeth.
    She was gifted with the complement of legs commonly worn at
    that period, supporting a body to which were loosely attached,
    in the manner of her country, as many arms as she had any use
    for, inasmuch as she was not required to hold baby. But all
    these charms were only so many objective points for the
    operations <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"
       id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span> of the paternal cudgel; for
       this father of hers was a hard, unfeeling man, who had no
       bowels of compassion for his bludgeon. He would put it to
       work early, and keep it going all day; and when it was worn
       out with hard service, instead of rewarding it with steady
       employment, he would cruelly throw it aside and get a fresh
       one. It is scarcely to be wondered at that a girl harried in
       this way should be driven to the insane expedient of falling
       in love.</p>

    <p>Near the neat mud cottage in which Simprella vegetated was a
    dense wood, extending for miles in various directions,
    according to the point from which it was viewed. By a method
    readily understood, it had been so arranged that it was the
    next easiest thing in the world to get into it, and the very
    easiest thing in the world to stay there.</p>

    <p>In the centre of this labyrinth was a castle of the early
    promiscuous order of architecture&mdash;an order which was
    until recently much employed in the construction of
    powder-works, but is now entirely exploded. In this baronial
    hall lived an eligible single party&mdash;a giant so tall he
    used a step-ladder to put on his hat, and could not put his
    hands into his pockets without kneeling. He lived entirely
    alone, and gave himself up to the practice of iniquity,
    devising prohibitory liquor laws, imposing the income tax, and
    drinking shilling claret. But, seeing Simprella one day, he
    bent himself into the form of a horse-shoe magnet to look into
    her eyes. Whether it was his magnetic attitude acting upon a
    young heart steeled by adversity, or his chivalric forbearance
    in not eating her, I know not: I only know that from that
    moment she became riotously enamoured of him; and the reader
    may accept either the scientific or the popular explanation,
    according to the bent of his
    mind.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>

    <p>She at once asked the giant in marriage, and obtained the
    consent of his parents by betraying her father into their
    hands; explaining to them, however, that he was not good to
    eat, but might be drunk on the premises.</p>

    <p>The marriage proved a very happy one, but the household
    duties of the bride were extremely irksome. It fatigued her to
    dress the beeves for dinner; it nearly broke her back to black
    her lord's boots without any scaffolding. It took her all day
    to perform any kindly little office for him. But she bore it
    all uncomplainingly, until one morning he asked her to part his
    back hair; then the bent sapling of her spirit flew up and hit
    him in the face. She gathered up some French novels, and
    retired to a lonely tower to breathe out her soul in unavailing
    regrets.</p>

    <p>One day she saw below her in the forest a dear gazelle,
    gladding her with its soft black eye. She leaned out of the
    window, and said <i>Scat!</i> The animal did not move. Then she
    waved her arms&mdash;above described&mdash;and said
    <i>Shew!</i> This time he did not move as much as he did
    before. Simprella decided he must have a bill against her; so
    she closed her shutters, drew down the blind, and pinned the
    curtains together. A moment later she opened them and peeped
    out. Then she went down to examine his collar, that she might
    order one like it.</p>

    <p>When the gazelle saw Simprella approach, he arose, and,
    beckoning with his tail, made off slowly into the wood. Then
    Simprella perceived this was a supernatural gazelle&mdash;a
    variety now extinct, but which then pervaded the Schwarzwald in
    considerable quantity&mdash;sent by some good magician, who
    owed the giant a grudge, to pilot her out of the forest.
    Nothing could exceed her joy at this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"
       id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> discovery: she whistled a
       dirge, sang a Latin hymn, and preached a funeral discourse
       all in one breath. Such were the artless methods by which
       the full heart in the fifteenth century was compelled to
       express its gratitute for benefits; the advertising columns
       of the daily papers were not then open to the benefactor's
       pen.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/140.jpg"><img width="404"
             src="images/140.jpg"
             alt="Simprella and Gazelle" /></a>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"
       id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>

    <p>All would now have been well, but for the fact that it was
    not. In following her deliverer, Simprella observed that his
    golden collar was inscribed with the mystic words&mdash;HANDS
    OFF! She tried hard to obey the injunction; she did her level
    best; she&mdash;but why amplify? Simprella was a woman.</p>

    <p>No sooner had her fingers touched the slender chain
    depending from the magic collar, than the poor animal's eyes
    emitted twin tears, which coursed silently but firmly down his
    nose, vacating it more in sorrow than in anger. Then he looked
    up reproachfully into her face. Those were his first
    tears&mdash;this was his last look. In two minutes by the watch
    he was blind as a mole!</p>

    <p>There is but little more to tell. The giant ate himself to
    death; the castle mouldered and crumbled into pig-pens; empires
    rose and fell; kings ascended their thrones, and got down
    again; mountains grew grey, and rivers bald-headed; suits in
    chancery were brought and decided, and those from the tailor
    were paid for; the ages came, like maiden aunts, uninvited, and
    lingered till they became a bore&mdash;and still Simprella,
    with the magician's curse upon her, conducted her sightless
    guide through the interminable wilderness!</p>

    <p>To all others the labyrinth had yielded up its clue. The
    hunter threaded its maze; the woodman plunged confidently into
    its innermost depths; the peasant child gathered ferns unscared
    in its sunless dells. But often the child abandoned his botany
    in terror, the woodman bolted for home, and the hunter's heart
    went down into his boots, at the sight of a fair young spectre
    leading a blind phantom through the silent glades. I saw them
    there in 1860, while I was gunning. I shot them.</p>
    <hr />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"
       id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>

    <h3>SEAFARING.</h3>

    <p>My envious rivals have always sought to cast discredit upon
    the following tale, by affirming that mere unadorned truth does
    not constitute a work of literary merit. Be it so: I care not
    what they call it. A rose with any other smell would be as
    sweet.</p>

    <p>In the autumn of 1868 I wanted to go from Sacramento,
    California, to San Francisco. I at once went to the railway
    office and bought a ticket, the clerk telling me that would
    take me there. But when I tried it, it wouldn't. Vainly I laid
    it on the railway and sat down upon it: it would not move; and
    every few minutes an engine would come along and crowd me off
    the track. I never travelled by so badly managed a line!</p>

    <p>I then resolved to go by way of the river, and took passage
    on a steamboat. The engineer of this boat had once been a
    candidate for the State Legislature while I was editing a
    newspaper. Stung to madness by the arguments I had advanced
    against his election (which consisted mainly in relating how
    that his cousin was hanged for horse-stealing, and how that his
    sister had an intolerable squint which a free people could
    never abide), he had sworn to be revenged. After his defeat I
    had confessed the charges were false, so far as he personally
    was concerned, but this did not seem to appease him. He
    declared he would "get even on me," and he did: he blew up the
    boat.</p>

    <p>Being thus summarily set ashore, I determined that I would
    be independent of common carriers destitute of common courtesy.
    I purchased a wooden box, just large enough to admit one, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"
       id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span> not transferable. I lay
       down in this, double-locked it on the outside, and carrying
       it to the river, launched it upon the watery waste. The box,
       I soon discovered, had an hereditary tendency to turn over.
       I had parted my hair in the middle before embarking, but the
       precaution was inadequate; it secured not immunity, only
       impartiality, the box turning over one way as readily as the
       other. I could counteract this evil only by shifting my
       tobacco from cheek to cheek, and in this way I got on
       tolerably well until my navy sprang a leak near the
       stern.</p>

    <p>I now began to wish I had not locked down the cover; I could
    have got out and walked ashore. But it was childish to give way
    to foolish regrets; so I lay perfectly quiet, and yelled.
    Presently I thought of my jack-knife. By this time the ship was
    so water-logged as to be a little more stable. This enabled me
    to get the knife from my pocket without upsetting more than six
    or eight times, and inspired hope. Taking the whittle between
    my teeth, I turned over upon my stomach, and cut a hole through
    the bottom near the bow. Turning back again, I awaited the
    result. Most men would have awaited the result, I think, if
    they could not have got out. For some time there was no result.
    The ship was too deeply laden astern, where my feet were, and
    water will not run up hill unless it is paid to do it. But when
    I called in all my faculties for a good earnest think, the
    weight of my intellect turned the scale. It was like a cargo of
    pig-lead in the forecastle. The water, which for nearly an hour
    I had kept down by drinking it as it rose about my lips, began
    to run out at the hole I had scuttled, faster than it could be
    admitted at the one in the stern; and in a few moments the
    bottom was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
       id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span> so dry you might have
       lighted a match upon it, if you had been there, and obtained
       the captain's permission.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/144.jpg"><img width="600"
             src="images/144.jpg"
             alt="Box Floating, Hand In View" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>I was all right now. I had got into San Pablo Bay, where it
    was all plain sailing. If I could manage to keep off the
    horizon I should be somewhere before daylight. But a new
    annoyance was in store for me. The steamboats on these waters
    are constructed of very frail materials, and whenever one came
    into collision with my flotilla, she immediately sank. This was
    most exasperating, for the piercing shrieks of the hapless
    crews and passengers prevented my getting any sleep. Such
    disagreeable voices as these people had would have tortured an
    ear of corn. I felt as if I would like to step out and beat
    them soft-headed with a club;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"
       id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span> though of course I had not
       the heart to do so while the padlock held fast.</p>

    <p>The reader, if he is obliging, will remember that there was
    formerly an obstruction in the harbour of San Francisco, called
    Blossom Rock, which was some fathoms under water, but not
    fathoms enough to suit shipmasters. It was removed by an
    engineer named Von Schmidt. This person bored a hole in it, and
    sent down some men who gnawed out the whole interior, leaving
    the rock a mere shell. Into this drawing-room suite were
    inserted thirty tons of powder, ten barrels of nitro-glycerine,
    and a woman's temper. Von Schmidt then put in something
    explosive, and corked up the opening, leaving a long wire
    hanging out. When all these preparations were complete, the
    inhabitants of San Francisco came out to see the fun. They
    perched thickly upon Telegraph Hill from base to summit; they
    swarmed innumerable upon the beach; the whole region was black
    with them. All that day they waited, and came again the next.
    Again they were disappointed, and again they returned full of
    hope. For three long weeks they did nothing but squat upon that
    eminence, looking fixedly at the wrong place. But when it
    transpired that Von Schmidt had hastily left the State directly
    he had completed his preparations, leaving the wire floating in
    the water, in the hope that some electrical eel might swim
    against it and ignite the explosives, the people began to abate
    their ardour, and move out of town. They said it might be a
    good while before a qualified gymnotus would pass that way,
    although the State Ichthyologer assured them that he had put
    some eels' eggs into the head waters of the Sacramento River
    not two weeks previously. But the country was very beautiful at
    that time of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"
       id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span> year, and the people would
       not wait. So when the explosion really occurred, there
       wasn't anybody in the vicinity to witness it. It was a
       stupendous explosion all the same, as the unhappy gymnotus
       discovered to his cost.</p>

    <p>Now, I have often thought that if this mighty convulsion had
    occurred a year or two earlier than it really did, it would
    have been bad for me as I floated idly past, unconscious of
    danger. As it was, my little bark was carried out into the
    broad Pacific, and sank in ten thousand fathoms of the coldest
    water!&mdash;it makes my teeth chatter to relate it!</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>TONY ROLLO'S CONCLUSION.</h3>

    <p>To a degree unprecedented in the Rollo family, of Illinois,
    Antony was an undutiful son. He was so undutiful that he may be
    said to have been preposterous. There were seven other
    sons&mdash;Antony was the eldest. His younger brothers were a
    nice, well-behaved bevy of boys as ever you saw. They always
    attended Sunday School regularly; arriving just before the
    Doxology (I think Sunday School exercises terminate that way),
    and sitting in a solemn row on a fence outside, waiting with
    pious patience for the girls to come forth; then they walked
    home with them as far as their respective gates. They were an
    obedient seven, too; they knew well enough the respect due to
    paternal authority, and when their father told them what was
    what, and which side up it ought to lie, they never tarried
    until he had more than picked up a hickory cudgel before
    tacitly admitting the correctness of the riper judgment. Had
    the old gentleman commanded the digging of seven
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"
       id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> graves, and the fabrication
       of seven board coffins to match, these necessaries would
       have been provided with unquestioning alacrity.</p>

    <p>But Antony, I bleed to state, was of an impractical, pensive
    turn. He despised industry, scoffed at Sunday-schooling, set up
    a private standard of morals, and rebelled against natural
    authority. He wouldn't be a dutiful son&mdash;not for money! He
    had no natural affections, and loved nothing so well as to sit
    and think. He was tolerably thoughtful all the time; but with
    some farming implement in his hand he came out strong. He has
    been known to take an axe between his knees, and sit on a stump
    in a "clearing" all day, wrapt in a single continuous
    meditation. And when interrupted by the interposition of night,
    or by the superposition of the paternal hickory, he would
    resume the meditation, next day, precisely where he left off,
    going on, and on, and on, in one profound and inscrutable
    think. It was a common remark in the neighbourhood that "If
    Tony Rollo didn't let up, he'd think his ridiculous white head
    off!" And on divers occasions when the old man's hickory had
    fallen upon that fleecy globe with unusual ardour, Tony really
    did think it off&mdash;until the continued pain convinced him
    it was there yet.</p>

    <p>You would like to know what Tony was thinking of, all these
    years. That is what they all wanted to know; but he didn't seem
    to tell. When the subject was mentioned he would always try to
    get away; and if he could not avoid a direct question, he would
    blush and stammer in so distressing a confusion that the doctor
    forbade all allusion to the matter, lest the young man should
    have a convulsion. It was clear enough, however, that the
    subject of Tony's meditation was "more than average
    inter<i>est</i>in'," as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"
       id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span> his father phrased it; for
       sometimes he would give it so grave consideration that
       observers would double their anxiety about the safety of his
       head, which he seemed in danger of snapping off with solemn
       nods; and at other times he would laugh immoderately,
       smiting his thigh or holding his sides in uncontrollable
       merriment. But it went on without abatement, and without any
       disclosure; went on until his poor mother's curiosity had
       worried her grey hairs in sorrow to the grave; went on until
       his father, having worn out all the hickory saplings on the
       place, had made a fair beginning upon the young oaks; went
       on until all the seven brothers, having married a
       Sunday-school girl each, had erected comfortable log-houses
       upon outlying corners of the father-in-legal farms; on, and
       ever on, until Tony was forty years of age! This appeared to
       be a turning-point in Tony's career&mdash;at this time a
       subtle change stole into his life, affecting both his inner
       and his outer self: he worked less than formerly, and
       thought a good deal more!</p>

    <p>Years afterwards, when the fraternal seven were well-to-do
    freeholders, with clouds of progeny, making their hearts light
    and their expenses heavy&mdash;when the old homestead was
    upgrown with rank brambles, and the live-stock long
    extinct&mdash;when the aged father had so fallen into the sere
    and yellow leaf that he couldn't hit hard enough to
    hurt&mdash;Tony, the mere shadow of his former self, sat, one
    evening, in the chimney corner, thinking very hard indeed. His
    father and three or four skeleton hounds were the only other
    persons present; the old gentleman quietly shelling a peck of
    Indian corn given by a grateful neighbour whose cow he had once
    pulled out of the mire, and the hounds thinking how cheerfully
    they would have assisted him had Nature
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"
       id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span> kindly made them
       graminivorous. Suddenly Tony spake.</p>

    <p>"Father," said he, looking straight across the top of the
    axe-handle which he held between his knees as a mental
    stimulant, "father, I've been thinking of something a good bit
    lately."</p>

    <p>"Jest thirty-five years, Tony, come next Thanksgiving,"
    replied the old man, promptly, in a thin asthmatic falsetto. "I
    recollect your mother used to say it dated from the time your
    Aunt Hannah was here with the girls."</p>

    <p>"Yes, father, I think it may be a matter of thirty-five
    years; though it don't seem so long, does it? But I've been
    thinking harder for the last week or two, and I'm going to
    speak out."</p>

    <p>Unbounded amazement looked out at the old man's eyes; his
    tongue, utterly unprepared for the unexpected contingency,
    refused its office; a corncob imperfectly denuded dropped from
    his nerveless hand, and was critically examined, in turn, by
    the gossamer dogs, hoping against hope. A smoking brand in the
    fireplace fell suddenly upon a bed of hot coals, where, lacking
    the fortitude of Guatimozin, it emitted a sputtering protest,
    followed by a thin flame like a visible agony. In the resulting
    light Tony's haggard face shone competitively with a ruddy
    blush, which spread over his entire scalp, to the imminent
    danger of firing his flaxen hair.</p>

    <p>"Yes, father," he answered, making a desperate clutch at
    calmness, but losing his grip, "I'm going to make a clean
    breast of it this time, for sure! Then you can do what you like
    about it."</p>

    <p>The paternal organ of speech found sufficient strength to
    grind out an intimation that the paternal ear was open for
    business.</p>

    <p>"I've studied it all over, father; I've looked at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"
       id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> it from every side; I've
       been through it with a lantern! And I've come to the
       conclusion that, seeing as I'm the oldest, it's about time I
       was beginning to think of getting married!"</p>

    <h3>NO CHARGE FOR ATTENDANCE.</h3>

    <p>Near the road leading from Deutscherkirche to Lagerhaus may
    be seen the ruins of a little cottage. It never was a very
    pretentious pile, but it has a history. About the middle of the
    last century it was occupied by one Heinrich Schneider, who was
    a small farmer&mdash;so small a farmer his clothes wouldn't fit
    him without a good deal of taking-in. But Heinrich Schneider
    was young. He had a wife, however&mdash;most small farmers have
    when young. They were rather poor: the farm was just large
    enough to keep them comfortably hungry.</p>

    <p>Schneider was not literary in his taste; his sole reading
    was an old dog's-eared copy of the "Arabian Nights" done into
    German, and in that he read nothing but the story of "Aladdin
    and his Wonderful Lamp." Upon his five hundredth perusal of
    that he conceived a valuable idea: he would rub <i>his</i> lamp
    and <i>corral</i> a Genie! So he put a thick leather glove on
    his right hand, and went to the cupboard to get out the lamp.
    He had no lamp. But this disappointment, which would have been
    instantly fatal to a more despondent man, was only an agreeable
    stimulus to him. He took out an old iron candle-snuffer, and
    went to work upon that.</p>

    <p>Now, iron is very hard; it requires more rubbing than any
    other metal. I once chafed a Genie out of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"
       id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span> an anvil, but I was quite
       weary before I got him all out; the slightest irritation of
       a leaden water-pipe would have fetched the same Genie out of
       it like a rat from his hole. But having planted all his
       poultry, sown his potatoes, and set out his wheat, Heinrich
       had the whole summer before him, and he was patient; he
       devoted all his time to compelling the attendance of the
       Supernatural.</p>

    <p>When the autumn came, the good wife reaped the chickens, dug
    out the apples, plucked the pigs and other cereals; and a
    wonderfully abundant harvest it was. Schneider's crops had
    flourished amazingly. That was because he did not worry them
    all summer with agricultural implements. One evening when the
    produce had been stored, Heinrich sat at his fireside operating
    upon his candle-snuffer with the same simple faith as in the
    early spring. Suddenly there was a knock at the door, and the
    expected Genie put in an appearance. His advent begot no little
    surprise in the good couple.</p>

    <p>He was a very substantial incarnation, indeed, of the
    Supernatural. About eight feet in length, extremely fat,
    thick-limbed, ill-favoured, heavy of movement, and generally
    unpretty, he did not at first sight impress his new master any
    too favourably.</p>

    <p>However, he was given a stool at the fireside, and Heinrich
    plied him with a multitude of questions: Where did he come
    from? whom had he last served? how did he like Aladdin? and did
    he think <i>they</i> should get on well? To all these queries
    the Genie returned evasive answers; he was Delphic to the verge
    of unintelligibility. He would only nod mysteriously, muttering
    beneath his breath in some unknown tongue, probably
    Arabic&mdash;in which, however, his master thought he could
    distinguish the words "roast" and "boiled" with significant
    frequency. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"
       id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span> This Genie must have served
       last in the capacity of cook.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/152.jpg"><img width="352"
             src="images/152.jpg"
             alt="Farmer, Wife and Genie" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>This was a gratifying discovery: for the next four
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"
       id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span> months or so there would be
       nothing to do about the farm; the Slave could prepare the
       family meals during the winter, and in the spring go
       regularly to work. Schneider was too shrewd to risk
       everything by extravagant demands all at once. He remembered
       the roc's egg of the legend, and thought he would proceed
       with caution. So the good couple brought out their cooking
       utensils, and by pantomime inducted the Slave into the
       mystery of their use. They showed him the larder, the
       cellars, the granary, the chicken-coops, and everything. He
       appeared interested and intelligent, apprehended the salient
       points of the situation with marvellous ease, and nodded
       like he would drop his big head off&mdash;did everything but
       talk.</p>

    <p>After this the <i>frau</i> prepared the evening meal, the
    Genie assisting very satisfactorily, except that his notions of
    quantity were rather too liberal; perhaps this was natural in
    one accustomed to palaces and courts. When all was on the
    table, by way of testing his Slave's obedience Heinrich sat
    down at the board and carelessly rubbed the candle-snuffer. The
    Genie was there in a second! Not only so, but he fell upon the
    viands with an ardour and sincerity that were alarming. In two
    minutes he had got away with everything on the table. The
    rapidity with which that spirit crowded all manner of edibles
    into his neck was simply shocking!</p>

    <p>Having finished his repast he stretched himself before the
    fire and went to sleep. Heinrich and Barbara were depressed in
    spirit; they sat up until nearly morning in silence, waiting
    for the Genie to vanish for the night; but he did not
    perceptibly vanish any. Moreover, he had not vanished next
    morning; he had risen with the lark, and was preparing
    breakfast, having made his estimates upon a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"
       id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span> basis of most immoderate
       consumption. To this he soon sat down with the same
       catholicity of appetite that had distinguished him the
       previous evening. Having bolted this preposterous breakfast
       he arrayed his fat face in a sable scowl, beat his master
       with a stewpan, stretched himself before the fire, and again
       addressed himself to sleep. Over a furtive and clandestine
       meal in the larder, Heinrich and Barbara confessed
       themselves thoroughly heart-sick of the Supernatural.</p>

    <p>"I told you so," said he; "depend upon it, patient industry
    is a thousand per cent. better than this invisible agency. I
    will now take the fatal candle-snuffer a mile from here, rub it
    real hard, fling it aside, and run away."</p>

    <p>But he didn't. During the night ten feet of snow had fallen.
    It lay all winter too.</p>

    <p>Early the next spring there emerged from that cottage by the
    wayside the unstable framework of a man dragging through seas
    of melting snow a tottering female of dejected aspect. Forlorn,
    crippled, famishing, and discouraged, these melancholy relics
    held on their way until they came to a cross-roads (all leading
    to Lagerhaus), where they saw clinging to an upright post the
    tatter of an old placard. It read as follows:</p>

    <div class="sign">
        <div class="figleft"
             style="padding:0">

                 alt="pointer" />
        </div>

        <p>LOST, strayed, or stolen, from Herr Schaackhofer's Grand
        Museum, the celebrated Patagonian Giant, Ugolulah. Height 8
        ft. 2 in., elegant figure, handsome, intelligent features,
        sprightly and vivacious in conversation, of engaging
        address, temperate in diet, harmless and tractable in
        disposition. Answers to the nickname of Fritz Sneddeker.

       id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>

    <p>It was a tempting offer, but they did not go back for the
    giant. But he was afterwards discovered sleeping sweetly upon
    the hearthstone, after a hearty meal of empty barrels and
    boxes. Being secured he was found to be too fat for egress by
    the door. So the house was pulled down to let him out; and that
    is how it happens to be in ruins now.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>PERNICKETTY'S FRIGHT.</h3>

    <p><i>"Sssssst!"</i></p>

    <p>Dan Golby held up his hand to enjoin silence; in a breath we
    were as quiet as mice. Then it came again, borne upon the night
    wind from away somewhere in the darkness toward the mountains,
    across miles of treeless plain&mdash;a low, dismal, sobbing
    sound, like the wail of a strangling child! It was nothing but
    the howl of a wolf, and a wolf is about the last thing a man
    who knows the cowardly beast would be afraid of; but there was
    something so weird and unearthly in this "cry between the
    silences"&mdash;something so banshee-like in its suggestion of
    the grave&mdash;that, old mountaineers that we were, and long
    familiar with it, we felt an instinctive dread&mdash;a dread
    which was not fear, but only a sense of utter solitude and
    desolation. There is no sound known to mortal ear that has in
    it so strange a power upon the imagination as the night-howl of
    this wretched beast, heard across the dreary wastes of the
    desert he disgraces.</p>

    <p>Involuntarily we drew nearer together, and some one of the
    party stirred the fire till it sent up a tall flame, widening
    the black circle shutting us in on all sides. Again rose the
    faint far cry, and was answered
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
       id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> by one fainter and more far
       in the opposite quarter. Then another, and yet another,
       struck in&mdash;a dozen, a hundred all at once; and in three
       minutes the whole invisible outer world seemed to consist
       mainly of wolves, jangled out of tune by some convulsion of
       nature.</p>

    <p>About this time it was a pleasing study to watch the
    countenance of Old Nick. This party had joined us at Fort
    Benton, whither he had come on a steamboat, up the Missouri.
    This was his maiden venture upon the plains, and his habit of
    querulous faultfinding had, on the first day out, secured him
    the <i>sobriquet</i> of Old Pernicketty, which the attrition of
    time had worn down to Old Nick. He knew no more of wolves and
    other animals than a naturalist, and he was now a trifle
    frightened. He was crouching beside his saddle and kit,
    listening with all his soul, his hands suspended before him
    with divergent fingers, his face ashy pale, and his jaw hanging
    unconsidered below.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Dan Golby, who had been watching him with an amused
    smile, assumed a grave aspect, listened a moment very intently,
    and remarked:</p>

    <p>"Boys, if I didn't <i>know</i> those were wolves, I should
    say we'd better get out of this."</p>

    <p>"Eh?" exclaimed Nick, eagerly; "if you did not know they
    were <i>wolves</i>? Why, what else, and what worse, could they
    be?"</p>

    <p>"Well, there's an innocent!" replied Dan, winking slyly at
    the rest of us. "Why, they <i>might</i> be Injuns, of course.
    Don't you know, you old bummer, that that's the way the red
    devils run a surprise party? Don't you know that when you hear
    a parcel of wolves letting on like that, at night, it's a
    hundred to one they carry bows and arrows?"</p>

    <p>Here one or two old hunters on the opposite side
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"
       id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span> of the fire, who had not
       caught Dan's precautionary wink, laughed good-humouredly,
       and made derisive comments. At this Dan seemed much vexed,
       and getting up, he strode over to them to argue it out. It
       was surprising how easily they were brought round to his way
       of thinking!</p>

    <p>By this time Old Nick was thoroughly perturbed. He fidgeted
    about, examining his rifle and pistols, tightened his belt, and
    looked in the direction of his horse. His anxiety became so
    painful that he did not attempt to conceal it. Upon our part,
    we affected to partially share it. One of us finally asked Dan
    if he was quite <i>sure</i> they were wolves. Then Dan listened
    a long time with his ear to the ground, after which he said,
    hesitatingly:</p>

    <p>"Well, no; there's no such thing as <i>absolute</i>
    certainty, I suppose; but I <i>think</i> they're wolves. Still,
    there's no harm in being ready for anything&mdash;always well
    to be ready, I suppose."</p>

    <p>Nick needed nothing more; he pounced upon his saddle and
    bridle, slung them upon his mustang, and had everything snug in
    less time than it takes to tell it. The rest of the party were
    far too comfortable to co-operate with Dan to any considerable
    extent; we contented ourselves with making a show of examining
    our weapons. All this time the wolves, as is their way when
    attracted by firelight, were closing in, clamouring like a
    legion of fiends. If Nick had known that a single pistol-shot
    would have sent them scampering away for dear life, I presume
    he would have fired one; as it was, he had Indian on the brain,
    and just stood by his horse, quaking till his teeth rattled
    like dice in a box.</p>

    <p>"No," pursued the implacable Dan, "these <i>can't</i> be
    Injuns; for if they were, we should, perhaps, hear an owl or
    two among them. The chiefs sometimes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"
       id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span> hoot, owl-fashion, just to
       let the rabble know they're standing up to the work like
       men, and to show where they are."</p>

    <p><i>"Too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooaw!"</i></p>

    <p>It took us all by surprise. Nick made one spring and came
    down astride his sleepy mustang, with force enough to have
    crushed a smaller beast. We all rose to our feet, except Jerry
    Hunker, who was lying flat on his stomach, with his head buried
    in his arms, and whom we had thought sound asleep. One look at
    <i>him</i> reassured us as to the "owl" business, and we
    settled back, each man pretending to his neighbour that he had
    got up merely for effect upon Nick.</p>

    <p>That man was now a sight to see. He sat in his saddle
    gesticulating wildly, and imploring us to get ready. He
    trembled like a jelly-fish. He took out his pistols, cocked
    them, and thrust them so back into the holsters, without
    knowing what he was about. He cocked his rifle, holding it with
    the muzzle directed anywhere, but principally our way; grasped
    his bowie-knife between his teeth, and cut his tongue trying to
    talk; spurred his nag into the fire, and backed him out across
    our blankets; and finally sat still, utterly unnerved, while we
    roared with the laughter we could no longer suppress.</p>

    <p><i>Hwissss! pft! swt! cheew!</i> Bones of C&aelig;sar! The
    arrows flitted and clipt amongst us like a flight of bats! Dan
    Golby threw a double-summersault, alighting on his head. Dory
    Durkee went smashing into the fire. Jerry Hunker was pinned to
    the sod where he lay fast asleep. Such dodging and ducking, and
    clawing about for weapons I never saw. And such genuine Indian
    yelling&mdash;it chills my marrow to write of it!</p>

    <p>Old Nick vanished like a dream; and long before
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"
       id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span> we could find our tools and
       get to work we heard the desultory reports of his pistols
       exploding in his holsters, as his pony measured off the
       darkness between us and safety.</p>

    <p>For some fifteen minutes we had tolerable warm work of it,
    individually, collectively, and miscellaneously; single-handed,
    and one against a dozen; struggling with painted savages in the
    firelight, and with one another in the dark; shooting the
    living, and stabbing the dead; stampeding our horses, and
    fighting <i>them</i>; battling with anything that would battle,
    and smashing our gunstocks on whatever would not!</p>

    <p>When all was done&mdash;when we had renovated our fire,
    collected our horses, and got our dead into position&mdash;we
    sat down to talk it over. As we sat there, cutting up our
    clothing for bandages, digging the poisoned arrow-heads out of
    our limbs, readjusting our scalps, or swapping them for such
    vagrant ones as there was nobody to identify, we could not help
    smiling to think how we had frightened Old Nick. Dan Golby, who
    was sinking rapidly, whispered that "it was the one sweet
    memory he had to sustain and cheer him in crossing the dark
    river into everlasting f&mdash;&mdash;." It is uncertain how
    Dan would have finished that last word; he may have meant
    "felicity"&mdash;he may have meant "fire." It is nobody's
    business.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>JUNIPER.</h3>

    <p>He was a dwarf, was Juniper. About the time of his birth
    Nature was executing a large order for prime giants, and had
    need of all her materials.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"
       id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span> Juniper infested the wooded
       interior of Norway, and dwelt in a cave&mdash;a miserable
       hole in which a blind bat in a condition of sempiternal
       torpor would have declined to hibernate, rent-free. Juniper
       was such a feeble little wretch, so inoffensive in his way
       of life, so modest in his demeanour, that every one was
       disposed to love him like a cousin; there was not enough of
       him to love like a brother. He, too, was inclined to return
       the affection; he was too weak to love very hard, but he
       made the best stagger at it he could. But a singular
       fatality prevented a perfect communion of soul between him
       and his neighbours. A strange destiny had thrown its shadow
       upon him, which made it cool for him in summer. There was a
       divinity that shaped his ends extremely rough, no matter how
       he hewed them.</p>

    <p>Somewhere in that vicinity lived a monstrous bear&mdash;a
    great hulking obnoxious beast who had no more soul than tail.
    This rascal had somehow conceived a notion that the appointed
    function of his existence was the extermination of the dwarf.
    If you met the latter you might rely with cheerful confidence
    upon seeing the ferocious brute in eager pursuit of him in less
    than a minute. No sooner would Juniper fairly accost you,
    looking timidly over his shoulder the while, than the raging
    savage would leap out of some contiguous jungle and make after
    him like a locomotive engine too late for the train. Then poor
    Juniper would streak it for the nearest crowd of people, diving
    and dodging amongst their shins with nimble skill, shrieking
    all the time like a panther. He was as earnest about it as if
    he had made a bet upon the result of the race. Of course
    everybody was too busy to stop, but in his blind terror the
    dwarf would single out some luckless wight&mdash;commonly some
    well-dressed person; Juniper instinctively sought the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"
       id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span> protection of the
       aristocracy&mdash;getting behind him, ducking between his
       legs, surrounding him, dancing through him&mdash;doing
       anything to save the paltry flitch of his own bacon.
       Presently the bear would lose all patience and nip the other
       fellow. Then, ashamed of losing his temper, he would sneak
       sullenly away, taking along the body. When he had gone, poor
       Juniper would fall upon his knees, tearing his beard,
       pounding his breast, and crying <i>Mea culpa</i> in deep
       remorse. Afterwards he would pay a visit of condolence to
       the bereaved relations and offer to pay the funeral
       expenses; but of course there never were any funeral
       expenses. Everybody, as before stated, liked the unhappy
       dwarf, but nobody liked the company he kept, and people were
       not at home to him as a rule. Whenever he came into a
       village traffic was temporarily suspended, and he was made
       the centre of as broad a solitude as could be hastily
       improvised.</p>

    <p>Many were the attempts to capture the terrible beast;
    hundreds of the country people would assemble to hunt him with
    guns and dogs. But even the dogs seemed to have an instinctive
    sense of some occult connection between him and the dwarf, and
    could never be made to understand that it was the former that
    was wanted. Directly they were laid on the scent they would
    forsake it to invest the dwarf's abode; and it was with much
    difficulty the pitying huntsmen could induce them to raise the
    siege. Things went on in this unsatisfactory fashion for years;
    the population annually decreasing, and Juniper making the most
    miraculous escapes.</p>

    <p>Now there resided in a small village near by, a brace of
    twins; little orphan girls, named Jalap and Ginseng. Their
    considerate neighbours had told them such pleasing tales about
    the bear that they <span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"
       id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span> decided to leave the
       country. So they got their valuables together in a box and
       set out. They met Juniper! He approached to inform them it
       was a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"
       id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span> fine morning, when the
       great beast of a bear "rose like the steam of rich distilled
       perfume" from the earth in front of them, and made a mouth
       at him. Juniper did not run, as might have been expected; he
       stood for a moment peering into the brute's cavernous jaws,
       and then flew! He absented himself with such extraordinary
       nimbleness that after he was a mile distant his image
       appeared to be standing there yet; and looking back he saw
       it himself. Baffled of his dwarf, the bear thought he would
       make a shift to get on, for the present, with an orphan. So
       he picked up Jalap by her middle, and thoughtfully
       withdrew.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

    </div>

    <p>The thankful but disgusted Ginseng continued her emigration,
    but soon missed the jewel-box, which in their alarm had been
    dropped and burst asunder. She did not much care for the
    jewels, but it contained some valuable papers, among them the
    "Examiner" (a print which once had the misfortune to condemn a
    book written by the author of this tale) and this she doted on.
    Returning for her property, she peered cautiously around the
    angle of a rock, and saw a spectacle that begot in her mind a
    languid interest. The bear had returned upon a similar mission;
    he was calmly distending his cheeks with the contents of the
    broken box. And perched on a rock near at hand sat Juniper
    waiting for him!</p>

    <p>It was natural that a suspicion of collusion between the two
    should dawn upon that infant's mind. It did dawn; it brightened
    and broadened into the perfect day of conviction. It was a
    revelation to the child. "At that moment," said she afterwards,
    "I felt that I could lay my finger on the best-trained bear in
    Christendom." But with praiseworthy moderation she controlled
    herself and didn't do it; she just stood still and allowed the
    beast to proceed. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"
       id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span> Having stored all the
       jewels in his capacious mouth, he began taking in the
       valuable papers. First some title-deeds disappeared; then
       some railway bonds; presently a roll of rent-receipts. All
       these seemed to be as honey to his tongue; he smiled a smile
       of tranquil happiness. Finally the newspaper vanished into
       his face like a wisp of straw drawn into a threshing
       machine.</p>

    <p>Then the brute expanded his mouth with a ludicrous gape,
    spilling out the jewels, a glittering shower. Then he snapped
    his jaws like a steel trap afflicted with <i>tetanus</i>, and
    stood on his head awhile. Next he made a feeble endeavour to
    complicate the relations between his parts&mdash;to tie himself
    into a love-knot. Failing in this he lay flat upon his side,
    wept, retched, and finally, fashioning his visage into the
    semblance of sickly grin, gave up the ghost. I don't know what
    he died of; I suppose it was hereditary in his family.</p>

    <p>The guilty come always to grief. Juniper was arrested,
    charged with conspiracy to kill, tried, convicted, sentenced to
    be hanged, and before the sun went down was pardoned. In
    searching his cavern the police discovered countless human
    bones, much torn clothing, and a mighty multitude of empty
    purses. But nothing of any value&mdash;not an article of any
    value. It was a mystery what Juniper had done with his
    ill-gotten valuables. The police confessed it was a
    mystery!</p>

    <h3>FOLLOWING THE SEA.</h3>

    <p>At the time of "the great earthquake of '68," I was at
    Arica, Peru. I have not a map by me, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"
       id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span> am not certain that Arica
       is not in Chili, but it can't make much difference; there
       was earthquake all along there. As nearly as I can remember
       it occured in August&mdash;about the middle of August, 1869
       or '70.</p>

    <p>Sam Baxter was with me; I think we had gone from San
    Francisco to make a railway, or something. On the morning of
    the 'quake, Sam and I had gone down to the beach to bathe. We
    had shed our boots and begun to moult, when there was a slight
    tremor of the earth, as if the elephant who supports it were
    pushing upwards, or lying down and getting up again. Next, the
    surges, which were flattening themselves upon the sand and
    dragging away such small trifles as they could lay hold of,
    began racing out seaward, as if they had received a telegraphic
    dispatch that somebody was not expected to live. This was
    needless, for <i>we</i> did not expect to live.</p>

    <p>When the sea had receded entirely out of sight, we started
    after it; for it will be remembered we had come to bathe; and
    bathing without some kind of water is not refreshing in a hot
    climate. I have heard that bathing in asses' milk is
    invigorating, but at that time I had no dealings with other
    authors. I have had no dealings with them since.</p>

    <p>For the first four or five miles the walking was very
    difficult, although the grade was tolerably steep. The ground
    was soft, there were tangled forests of sea-weed, old rotting
    ships, rusty anchors, human skeletons, and a multitude of
    things to impede the pedestrian. The floundering sharks bit our
    legs as we toiled past them, and we were constantly slipping
    down upon the flat fish strewn about like orange-peel on a
    sidewalk. Sam, too, had stuffed his shirt-front with such a
    weight of Spanish <span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"
       id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span> doubloons from the wreck of
       an old galleon, that I had to help him across all the worst
       places. It was very dispiriting.</p>

    <p>Presently, away on the western horizon, I saw the sea coming
    back. It occurred to me then that I did not wish it to come
    back. A tidal wave is nearly always wet, and I was now a good
    way from home, with no means of making a fire.</p>

    <p>The same was true of Sam, but he did not appear to think of
    it in that way. He stood quite still a moment with his eyes
    fixed on the advancing line of water; then turned to me,
    saying, very earnestly:</p>

    <p>"Tell you what, William; I never wanted a ship so bad from
    the cradle to the grave! I would give m-o-r-e for a
    ship!&mdash;more than for all the railways and turnpikes you
    could scare up! I'd give more than a hundred, thousand, million
    dollars! I would&mdash;I'd give all I'm worth, and all my Erie
    shares, for&mdash;just&mdash;one&mdash;little&mdash;ship!"</p>

    <p>To show how lightly he could part with his wealth, he lifted
    his shirt out of his trousers, unbosoming himself of his
    doubloons, which tumbled about his feet, a golden storm.</p>

    <p>By this time the tidal wave was close upon us. Call
    <i>that</i> a wave! It was one solid green wall of water,
    higher than Niagara Falls, stretching as far as we could see to
    right and left, without a break in its towering front! It was
    by no means clear what we ought to do. The moving wall showed
    no projections by means of which the most daring climber could
    hope to reach the top. There was no ivy; there were no
    window-ledges. Stay!&mdash;there was the lightning-conductor!
    No, there wasn't any lightning-conductor. Of course, not!</p>

    <p>Looking despairingly upward, I made a tolerably good
    beginning at thinking of all the mean actions
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"
       id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span> I had wrought in the flesh,
       when I saw projecting beyond the crest of the wave a ship's
       bowsprit, with a man sitting on it, reading a newspaper!
       Thank fortune, we were saved!</p>

    <p>Falling upon our knees with tearful gratitude, we got up
    again and ran&mdash;ran as fast as we could, I suspect; for now
    the whole fore-part of the ship bulged through the water
    directly above our heads, and might lose its balance any
    moment. If we had only brought along our umbrellas!</p>

    <p>I shouted to the man on the bowsprit to drop us a line. He
    merely replied that his correspondence was already very
    onerous, and he hadn't any pen and ink.</p>

    <p>Then I told him I wanted to get aboard. He said I would find
    one on the beach, about three leagues to the south'ard, where
    the "Nancy Tucker" went ashore.</p>

    <p>At these replies I was disheartened. It was not so much that
    the man withheld assistance, as that he made puns. Presently,
    however, he folded his newspaper, put it carefully away in his
    pocket, went and got a line, and let it down to us just as we
    were about to give up the race. Sam made a lunge at it, and got
    it&mdash;right into his side! For the fiend above had appended
    a shark-hook to the end of the line&mdash;which was <i>his</i>
    notion of humour. But this was no time for crimination and
    recrimination. I laid hold of Sam's legs, the end of the rope
    was passed about the capstan, and as soon as the men on board
    had had a little grog, we were hauled up. I can assure you that
    it was no fine experience to go up in that way, close to the
    smooth vertical front of water, with the whales tumbling out
    all round and above us, and the sword-fishes nosing us
    pointedly with vulgar
    curiosity.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"
       id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>

    <p>We had no sooner set foot on deck, and got Sam disengaged
    from the hook, than the purser stepped up with book and
    pencil.</p>

    <p>"Tickets, gentlemen."</p>

    <p>We told him we hadn't any tickets, and he ordered us to be
    set ashore in a boat. It was represented to him that this was
    quite impossible under the circumstances; but he replied that
    he had nothing to do with circumstances&mdash;did not know
    anything about circumstances. Nothing would move him till the
    captain, who was a really kind-hearted man, came on deck and
    knocked him overboard with a spare topmast. We were now
    stripped of our clothing, chafed all over with stiff brushes,
    rolled on our stomachs, wrapped in flannels, laid before a hot
    stove in the saloon, and strangled with scalding brandy. We had
    not been wet, nor had we swallowed any sea-water, but the
    surgeon said this was the proper treatment. I suspect, poor
    man, he did not often get the opportunity to resuscitate
    anybody; in fact, he admitted he had not had any such case as
    ours for years. It is uncertain what he might have done to us
    if the tender-hearted captain had not thrashed him into his
    cabin with a knotted hawser, and told us to go on deck.</p>

    <p>By this time the ship was passing above the town of Arica,
    and the sailors were all for'd, sitting on the bulwarks,
    snapping peas and small shot at the terrified inhabitants
    flitting through the streets a hundred feet below. These
    harmless projectiles rattled very merrily upon the upturned
    boot-soles of the fleeting multitude; but not seeing any fun in
    this, we were about to go astern and fish a little, when the
    ship grounded on a hill-top. The captain hove out all the
    anchors he had about him; and when the water went swirling back
    to its legal level, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"
       id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span> taking the town along for
       company, there we were, in the midst of a charming
       agricultural country, but at some distance from any
       sea-port.</p>

    <p>At sunrise next morning we were all on deck. Sam sauntered
    aft to the binnacle, cast his eye carelessly upon the compass,
    and uttered an ejaculation of astonishment.</p>

    <p>"Tell <i>you</i>, captain," he called out, "this has been a
    direr convulsion of nature than you have any idea. Everything's
    been screwed right round. Needle points due south!"</p>

    <p>"Why, you cussed lubber!" growled the skipper, moving up and
    taking a look, "it p'ints d'rectly to labbard, an' there's the
    sun, dead ahead!"</p>

    <p>Sam turned and confronted him, with a steady gaze of
    ineffable contempt.</p>

    <p>"Now, who said it wasn't dead ahead?&mdash;tell me
    <i>that</i>. Shows how much <i>you</i> know about earthquakes.
    'Course, I didn't mean just this continent, nor just this
    earth: I tell you, the <i>whole thing's</i> turned!"</p>

    <h3>A TALE OF SPANISH VENGEANCE.</h3>

    <p>Don Hemstitch Blodoza was an hidalgo&mdash;one of the
    highest dalgos of old Spain. He had a comfortably picturesque
    castle on the Guadalquiver, with towers, battlements, and
    mortages on it; but as it belonged, not to his own creditors,
    but to those of his bitterest enemy, who inhabited it, Don
    Hemstitch preferred the forest as a steady residence. He had
    that curse of Spanish pride which will not permit one to be a
    burden upon the man who may happen to have massacred all one's
    relations, and set a price upon the heads of one's family
    generally. He had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"
       id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span> made a vow never to accept
       the hospitality of Don Symposio&mdash;not if he died for it.
       So he pervaded the romantic dells, and the sunless jungle
       was infected with the sound of his guitar. He rose in the
       morning and laved him in the limpid brooklet; and the beams
       of the noonday sun fell upon him in the pursuit of
       diet&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The thistle's downy seed his fare,</p>

            <p class="i2">His drink the morning dew."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>He throve but indifferently upon this meagre regimen, but
    beyond all other evils a true Spaniard of the poorer sort
    dreads obesity. During the darkest night of the season he will
    get up at an absurd hour and stab his best friend in the back
    rather than grow fat.</p>

    <p>It will of course be suspected by the experienced reader
    that Don Hemstitch did not have any bed. Like the Horatian
    lines above quoted&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"He perched at will on every spray."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In translating this tale into the French, M. Victor Hugo
    will please twig the proper meaning of the word "spray"; I
    shall be very angry if he make it appear that my hero is a
    gull.</p>

    <p>One morning while Don Hemstitch was dozing upon his leafy
    couch&mdash;not his main couch, but a branch&mdash;he was
    roused from his tranquil nap by the grunting of swine; or, if
    you like subtle distinctions, by the sound of human voices.
    Peering cautiously through his bed-hangings, he saw below him
    at a little distance two of his countrymen in conversation. The
    fine practised phrenzy of their looks, their excellently
    rehearsed air of apprehensive secrecy, showed him they were
    merely conspiring against somebody's life; and he dismissed the
    matter <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"
       id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span> from his mind until the
       mention of his own name recalled his attention. One of the
       conspirators was urging the other to make one of a
       joint-stock company for the Don's assassination; but the
       more conscientious plotter would not consent.</p>

    <p>"The laws of Spain," said the latter, "with which we have an
    acquaintance meanly withheld from the attorneys, enjoin that
    when one man murders another, except for debt, he must make
    provision for the widow and orphans. I leave it to you if,
    after the summer's unprofitable business, we are in a position
    to assume the care and education of a large family. We have not
    a single asset, and our liabilities amount to fourteen widows,
    and more than thirty children of strong and increasing
    appetite.</p>

    <p>"<i>Car-r-rajo!"</i> hissed the other through his beard; "we
    will slaughter the lot of them!"</p>

    <p>At this cold-blooded proposition his merciful companion
    recoiled aghast.</p>

    <p>"<i>Diablo</i>!" he shrieked. "Tempt me no farther. What!
    immolate a whole hecatomb of guiltless women and children?
    Consider the funeral expense!"</p>

    <p>There is really no moving the law-abiding soul to crime of
    doubtful profit. But Don Hemstitch was not at ease; he could
    not say how soon it might transpire that he had nor chick nor
    child. Should Don Symposio pass that way and communicate this
    information&mdash;and he was in a position to know&mdash;the
    moral scruples of the conscientious plotter would vanish like
    the baseless fabric of a beaten cur. Moreover, it is always
    unpleasant to be included in a conspiracy in which one is not a
    conspirator. Don Hemstitch resolved to sell his life at the
    highest market price.</p>

    <p>Hastily descending his tree, he wrapped his cloak
    <!--illustration moved from page 165, leaving blank page-->
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"
       id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span> about him and stood for
       some time, wishing he had a poniard. Trying the temper of
       this upon his thumbnail, he found it much more amiable than
       his own. It was a keen Toledo blade&mdash;keen enough to
       sever a hare. To nerve himself for the deadly work before
       him, he began thinking of a lady whom he had once
       met&mdash;the lovely Donna Lavaca, beloved of El
       Toro-blanco. Having thus wrought up his Castilian soul to a
       high pitch of jealously, he felt quite irresistible, and
       advanced towards the two ruffians with his poniard deftly
       latent in his flowing sleeve. His mien was hostile, his
       stride puissant, his nose tip-tilted&mdash;not to put too
       fine a point upon it, petallic. Don Hemstitch was upon the
       war-path with all his might. The forest trembled as he
       trode, the earth bent like thin ice beneath his heel. Birds,
       beasts, serpents, and poachers fled affrighted to the right
       and left of his course. He came down upon the unsuspecting
       assassins like a mild Spanish avalanche.</p>

    <p>"<i>Senores!</i>" he thundered, with a frightful scowl and a
    faint aroma of garlic, "patter your <i>pater-nosters</i> as
    fast as you conveniently may. You have but ten minutes to
    exist. Has either of you a watch?"</p>

    <p>Then might you have seen a guilty dismay over-spreading the
    faces of two sinners, like a sudden snow paling twin mountain
    peaks. In the presence of Death, Crime shuddered and sank into
    his boots. Conscience stood appalled in the sight of
    Retribution. In vain the villains essayed speech; each palsied
    tongue beat out upon the yielding air some weak words of
    supplication, then clave to its proper concave. Two pairs of
    brawny knees unsettled their knitted braces, and bent limply
    beneath their loads of incarnate wickedness swaying unsteadily
    above. With clenched hands and streaming eyes these wretched
    men prayed silently. At <span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"
       id="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span> this supreme moment an
       American gentleman sitting by, with his heels upon a rotted
       oaken stump, tilted back his chair, laid down his newspaper,
       and began operating upon a half-eaten apple-pie. One glance
       at the title of that print&mdash;one look at that calm
       angular face clasped in its crescent of crisp
       crust&mdash;and Don Hemstitch Blodoza reeled, staggered like
       an exhausted spinning-top. He spread his baffled hand upon
       his eyes, and sank heavily to earth!</p>

    <p>"Saved! saved!" shrieked the penitent conspirators,
    springing to their feet. The far deeps of the forest whispered
    in consultation, and a distant hillside echoed back the words.
    "Saved!" sang the rocks&mdash;"Saved!" the glad birds twittered
    from the leaves above. The hare that Don Hemstitch Blodoza's
    poniard would have severed limped awkwardly but confidently
    about, saying, "Saved!" as well as he knew how.</p>

    <p>Explanation is needless. The American gentleman was the
    Special Correspondent of the "New York Herald." It is tolerably
    well known that except beneath his searching eye no
    considerable event can occur&mdash;and his whole attention was
    focused upon that apple-pie!</p>

    <p>That is how Spanish vengeance was balked of its issue.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>MRS. DENNISON'S HEAD.</h3>

    <p>While I was employed in the Bank of Loan and Discount (said
    Mr. Applegarth, smiling the smile with which he always prefaced
    a nice old story), there was another clerk there, named
    Dennison&mdash;a quiet, reticent fellow, the very soul of
    truth, and a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"
       id="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span> great favourite with us
       all. He always wore crape on his hat, and once when asked
       for whom he was in mourning he replied his wife, and seemed
       much affected. We all expressed our sympathy as delicately
       as possible, and no more was said upon the subject. Some
       weeks after this he seemed to have arrived at that stage of
       tempered grief at which it becomes a relief to give sorrow
       words&mdash;to speak of the departed one to sympathizing
       friends; for one day he voluntarily began talking of his
       bereavement, and of the terrible calamity by which his wife
       had been deprived of her head!</p>

    <p>This sharpened our curiosity to the keenest edge; but of
    course we controlled it, hoping he would volunteer some further
    information with regard to so singular a misfortune; but when
    day after day went by and he did not allude to the matter, we
    got worked up into a fever of excitement about it. One evening
    after Dennison had gone, we held a kind of political meeting
    about it, at which all possible and impossible methods of
    decapitation were suggested as the ones to which Mrs. D.
    probably owed her extraordinary demise. I am sorry to add that
    we so far forgot the grave character of the event as to lay
    small wagers that it was done this way or that way; that it was
    accidental or premeditated; that she had had a hand in it
    herself or that it was wrought by circumstances beyond her
    control. All was mere conjecture, however; but from that time
    Dennison, as the custodian of a secret upon which we had staked
    our cash, was an object of more than usual interest. It wasn't
    entirely that, either; aside from our paltry wagers, we felt a
    consuming curiosity to know the truth for its own sake. Each
    set himself to work to elicit the dread secret in some way; and
    the misdirected ingenuity we developed was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"
       id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span> wonderful. All sorts of
       pious devices were resorted to to entice poor Dennison into
       clearing up the mystery. By a thousand indirect methods we
       sought to entrap him into divulging all. History, fiction,
       poesy&mdash;all were laid under contribution, and from
       Goliah down, through Charles I., to Sam Spigger, a local
       celebrity who got his head entangled in mill machinery,
       every one who had ever mourned the loss of a head received
       his due share of attention during office hours. The
       regularity with which we introduced, and the pertinacity
       with which we stuck to, this one topic came near getting us
       all discharged; for one day the cashier came out of his
       private office and intimated that if we valued our
       situations the subject of hanging would afford us the means
       of retaining them. He added that he always selected his
       subordinates with an eye to their conversational abilities,
       but variety of subject was as desirable, at times, as
       exhaustive treatment.</p>

    <p>During all this discussion Dennison, albeit he had evinced
    from the first a singular interest in the theme, and shirked
    not his fair share of the conversation, never once seemed to
    understand that it had any reference to himself. His frank
    truthful nature was quite unable to detect the personal
    significance of the subject. It was plain that nothing short of
    a definite inquiry would elicit the information we were dying
    to obtain; and at a "caucus," one evening, we drew lots to
    determine who should openly propound it. The choice fell upon
    me.</p>

    <p>Next morning we were at the bank somewhat earlier than
    usual, waiting impatiently for Dennison and the time to open
    the doors: they always arrived together. When Dennison stepped
    into the room, bowing in his engaging manner to each clerk as
    he passed to his own desk, I confronted him, shaking
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"
       id="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span> him warmly by the hand. At
       that moment all the others fell to writing and figuring with
       unusual avidity, as if thinking of anything under the sun
       except Dennison's wife's head.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Dennison," I began, as carelessly as I could manage it;
    "speaking of decapitation reminds me of something I would like
    to ask you. I have intended asking it several times, but it has
    always slipped my memory. Of course you will pardon me if it is
    not a fair question."</p>

    <p>As if by magic, the scratching of pens died away, leaving a
    dead silence which quite disconcerted me; but I blundered
    on:</p>

    <p>"I heard the other day&mdash;that is, you said&mdash;or it
    was in the newspapers&mdash;-or somewhere&mdash;something about
    your poor wife, you understand&mdash;about her losing her head.
    Would you mind telling me how such a distressing
    accident&mdash;if it was an accident&mdash;occurred?"</p>

    <p>When I had finished, Dennison walked straight past me as if
    he didn't see me, went round the counter to his stool, and
    perched himself gravely on the top of it, facing the other
    clerks. Then he began speaking, calmly, and without apparent
    emotion:</p>

    <p>"Gentlemen, I have long desired to speak of this thing, but
    you gave me no encouragement, and I naturally supposed you were
    indifferent. I now thank you all for the friendly interest you
    take in my affairs. I will satisfy your curiosity upon this
    point at once, if you will promise never hereafter to allude to
    the matter, and to ask not a single question now."</p>

    <p>We all promised upon our sacred honour, and collected about
    him with the utmost eagerness. He bent his head a moment, then
    raised it, quietly
    saying:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"
       id="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span>

    <p>"My poor wife's head was bitten off!"</p>

    <p>"By what?" we all exclaimed eagerly, with suspended
    breath.</p>

    <p>He gave us a look full of reproach, turned to his desk, and
    went at his work.</p>

    <p>We went at ours.</p>

    <h3>A FOWL WITCH.</h3>

    <p>Frau Gaubenslosher was strongly suspected of witchcraft. I
    don't think she was a witch, but would not like to swear she
    was not, in a court of law, unless a good deal depended upon my
    testimony, and I had been properly suborned beforehand. A great
    many persons accused of witchcraft have themselves stoutly
    disbelieved the charge, until, when subjected to shooting with
    a silver bullet or boiling in oil, they have found themselves
    unable to endure the test. And it must be confessed appearances
    were against the Frau. In the first place, she lived quite
    alone in a forest, and had no visiting list. This was
    suspicious. Secondly&mdash;and it was thus, mainly, that she
    had acquired her evil repute&mdash;all the barn-yard fowls in
    the vicinity seemed to bear her the most uncompromising
    ill-will. Whenever she passed a flock of hens, or ducks, or
    turkeys, or geese, one of them, with dropped wings, extended
    neck, and open bill, would start in hot pursuit. Sometimes the
    whole flock would join in for a few moments with shrill
    clamour; but there would always be one fleeter and more
    determined than the rest, and that one would keep up the chase
    with unflagging zeal clean out of
    sight.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"
       id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span>

    <p>Upon these occasions the dame's fright was painful to
    behold. She would not scream&mdash;her organs of screech seemed
    to have lost their power&mdash;nor, as a rule, would she curse;
    she would just address herself to silent prayerful speed, with
    every symptom of abject terror!</p>

    <p>The Frau's explanation of this unnatural persecution was
    singularly weak. Upon a certain night long ago, said she, a
    poor bedraggled and attenuated gander had applied at her door
    for relief. He stated in piteous accents that he had eaten
    nothing for months but tin-tacks and an occasional beer-bottle;
    and he had not roosted under cover for so long a time he did
    not know what it was like. Would she give him a place on her
    fender, and fetch out six or eight cold pies to amuse him while
    she was preparing his supper? To this plea she turned a deaf
    ear, and he went away. He came again the next night, however,
    bringing a written certificate from a clergyman that his case
    was a deserving one. She would not aid him, and he departed.
    The night after he presented himself again, with a paper signed
    by the relieving officer of the parish, stating that the
    necessity for help was most urgent.</p>

    <p>By this time the Frau's good-nature was quite exhausted: she
    slew him, dressed him, put him in a pot, and boiled him. She
    kept him boiling for three or four days, but she did not eat
    him because her teeth were just like anybody's teeth&mdash;no
    weaker, perhaps, but certainly no stronger nor sharper. So she
    fed him to a threshing machine of her acquaintance, which
    managed to masticate some of the more modern portions, but was
    hopelessly wrecked upon the neck. From that time the poor
    beldame had lived under the ban of a great
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"
       id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span> curse. Hens took after her
       as naturally as after the soaring beetle; geese pursued her
       as if she were a fleeting tadpole; ducks, turkeys, and
       guinea fowl camped upon her trail with tireless
       pertinacity.</p>

    <p>Now there was a leaven of improbability in this tale, and it
    leavened the whole lump. Ganders do not roost; there is not one
    in a hundred of them that could sit on a fender long enough to
    say Jack Robinson. So, as the Frau lived a thousand years
    before the birth of common sense&mdash;say about a half century
    ago&mdash;when everything uncommon had a smell of the
    supernatural, there was nothing for it but to consider her a
    witch. Had she been very feeble and withered, the people would
    have burned her, out of hand; but they did not like to proceed
    to extremes without perfectly legal evidence. They were
    cautious, for they had made several mistakes recently. They had
    sentenced two or three females to the stake, and upon being
    stripped the limbs and bodies of these had not redeemed the
    hideous promise of their shrivelled faces and hands. Justice
    was ashamed of having toasted comparatively plump and
    presumably innocent women; and the punishment of this one was
    wisely postponed until the proof should be all in.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/182.jpg"><img width="349"
             src="images/182.jpg"
             alt="Hans Catches the Frau" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>But in the meantime a graceless youth, named Hans
    Blisselwartle, made the startling discovery that none of the
    fowls that pursued the Frau ever came back to boast of it. A
    brief martial career seemed to have weaned them from the arts
    of peace and the love of their kindred. Full of unutterable
    suspicion, Hans one day followed in the rear of an exciting
    race between the timorous dame and an avenging pullet. They
    were too rapid for him; but bursting suddenly in at the lady's
    door some <span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"
       id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span> fifteen minutes afterward,
       he found her in the act of placing the plucked and
       eviscerated Nemesis upon her cooking range. The Frau
       betrayed considerable confusion; and although the accusing
       Blisselwartle could not but recognize in her act a certain
       poetic justice, he could not conceal from himself that there
       was something grossly selfish and sordid in it. He thought
       it was a good deal like bottling an annoying ghost and
       selling him for clarified moonlight; or like haltering a
       nightmare and putting her to the cart.</p>

    <p>When it transpired that the Frau ate her feathered
    persecutors, the patience of the villagers refused to honour
    the new demand upon it: she was at once arrested, and charged
    with prostituting a noble superstition to a base selfish end.
    We will pass over the trial; suffice it she was convicted. But
    even then they had not the heart to burn a middle-aged woman,
    with full rounded outlines, as a witch, so they broke her upon
    the wheel as a thief.</p>

    <p>The reckless antipathy of the domestic fowls to this
    inoffensive lady remains to be explained. Having rejected her
    theory, I am bound in honour to set up one of my own. Happily
    an inventory of her effects, now before me, furnishes a
    tolerably safe basis. Amongst the articles of personal property
    I note "One long, thin, silken fishing line, and hook." Now if
    I were a barn-yard fowl&mdash;say a goose&mdash;and a lady not
    a friend of mine were to pass me, munching sweetmeats, and were
    to drop a nice fat worm, passing on apparently unconscious of
    her loss, I think I should try to get away with that worm. And
    if after swallowing it I felt drawn towards that lady by a
    strong personal attachment, I suppose that I should yield if I
    could not help it. And then if the lady chose to run and I
    chose to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"
       id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span> follow, making a good deal
       of noise, I suppose it would look as if I were engaged in a
       very reprehensible pursuit, would it not? With the light I
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"
       id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span> have, that is the way in
       which the case presents itself to my intelligence; though,
       of course, I may be wrong.</p>

    <h3>THE CIVIL SERVICE IN FLORIDA.</h3>

    <p>Colonel Bulper was of a slumberous turn. Most people are
    not: they work all day and sleep all night&mdash;are always in
    one or the other condition of unrest, and never slumber. Such
    persons, the Colonel used to remark, are fit only for sentry
    duty; they are good to watch our property while we take our
    rest&mdash;and they take the property. But this tale is not of
    them; it is of Colonel Bulper.</p>

    <p>There was a fellow named Halsey, a practical joker, and one
    of the most disagreeable of his class. He would remain broad
    awake for a year at a time, for no other purpose than to break
    other people of their natural rest. And I must admit that from
    the wreck of his faculties upon the rock of <i>insomnia</i> he
    had somehow rescued a marvellous ingenuity and fertility of
    expedient. But this tale is not so much of him as of Colonel
    Bulper.</p>

    <p>At the time of which I write, the Colonel was the Collector
    of Customs at a sea-port town in Florida, United States. The
    climate there is perpetual summer; it never rains, nor
    anything; and there was no good reason why the Colonel should
    not have enjoyed it to the top of his bent, as there was enough
    for all. In point of fact, the Collectorship had been given him
    solely that he might repair his wasted vitality by a short
    season of unbroken repose; for during the Presidential canvass
    immediately preceding his appointment he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"
       id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span> had been kept awake a long
       time by means of strong tea, in order to deliver an able and
       exhaustive political argument prepared by the candidate, who
       was ultimately successful in spite of it. Halsey, who had
       favoured the other aspirant, was a merchant, and had nothing
       in the world to do but annoy the collector. If the latter
       could have kept away from him, the dignity of the office
       might have been preserved, and the object of the incumbent's
       appointment to it attained; but sneak away whithersoever he
       might&mdash;into the heart of the dismal swamp, or anywhere
       in the Everglades&mdash;some vagrom Indian or casual negro
       was sure to stumble over him before long, and go and tell
       Halsey, securing a plug of tobacco for reward. Or if he was
       not found in this way, some company was tolerably certain,
       in the course of time, to survey a line of railway athwart
       his leafy couch, and laying his prostrate trunk aside out of
       the way, send word to his persecutor; who, as soon as the
       line was as nearly completed as it ever would be, would come
       down on horseback with some diabolical device for waking the
       slumberer. I will confess there is a subtle seeming of
       unlikelihood about all this; but in the land where Ponce de
       Leon searched for the Fountain of Youth there is an air of
       unreality in everything. I can only say I have had the story
       by me a long time, and it seems to me just as true as it was
       the day I wrote it.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the Colonel would seek out a hillside with a
    southern exposure; but no sooner would he compose his members
    for a bit of slumber, than Halsey would set about making
    inquiries for him, under pretence that a ship was <i>en
    route</i> from Liverpool, and the collector's signature might
    be required for her anchoring papers. Having traced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"
       id="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span> him&mdash;which, owing to
       the meddlesome treachery of the venal natives, he was always
       able to do&mdash;Halsey would set off to Texas for a seed of
       the prickly pear, which he would plant exactly beneath the
       slumberer's body. This he called a triumph of modern
       engineering! As soon as the young vegetable had pushed its
       spines above the soil, of course the Colonel would have to
       get up and seek another spot&mdash;and this nearly always
       waked him.</p>

    <p>Upon one occasion the Colonel existed five consecutive days
    without slumber&mdash;travelling all day and sleeping in the
    weeds at night&mdash;to find an almost inaccessible crag, on
    the summit of which he hoped to be undisturbed until the action
    of the dew should wear away the rock all round his body, when
    he expected and was willing to roll off and wake. But even
    there Halsey found him out, and put eagles' eggs in his
    southern pockets to hatch. When the young birds were well
    grown, they pecked so sharply at the Colonel's legs that he had
    to get up and wring their necks. The malevolence of people who
    scorn slumber seems to be practically unlimited.</p>

    <p>At last the Colonel resolved upon revenge, and having
    dreamed out a feasible plan, proceeded to put it into
    execution. He had in the warehouse some Government powder, and
    causing a keg of this to be conveyed into his private office,
    he knocked out the head. He next penned a note to Halsey,
    asking him to step down to the office "upon important
    business;" adding in a postscript, "As I am liable to be called
    out for a few moments at any time, in case you do not find me
    in, please sit down and amuse yourself with the newspaper until
    I return." He knew Halsey was at his counting-house, and would
    certainly come if only <span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"
       id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span> to learn what signification
       a Government official attached to the word "business." Then
       the Colonel procured a brief candle and set it into the
       powder. His plan was to light the candle, dispatch a porter
       with the message, and bolt for home. Having completed his
       preparations, he leaned back in his easy chair and smiled.
       He smiled a long time, and even achieved a chuckle. For the
       first time in his life, he felt a serene sense of happiness
       in being particularly wide awake. Then, without moving from
       his chair, he ignited the taper, and put out his hand toward
       the bell-cord, to summon the porter. At this stage of his
       vengeance the Colonel fell into a tranquil and refreshing
       slumber.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is nothing omitted here; that is merely the Colonel's
    present address.</p>

    <h3>A TALE OF THE BOSPHORUS.</h3>

    <p>Pollimariar was the daughter of a Mussulman&mdash;she was,
    in fact, a Mussulgirl. She lived at Stamboul, the name of which
    is an admirable rhyme to what Pollimariar was profanely
    asserted to be by her two sisters, Djainan and Djulya. These
    were very much older than Pollimariar, and proportionately
    wicked. In wickedness they could discount her, giving her the
    first innings.</p>

    <p>The relations between Pollimariar and her sisters were in
    all respects similar to those that existed between Cinderella
    and <i>her</i> sisters. Indeed, these big girls seldom read
    anything but the story of Cinderella; and that work, no doubt,
    had its influence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"
       id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span> in forming their character.
       They were always apparelling themselves in gaudy dresses
       from Paris, and going away to balls, leaving their
       meritorious little sister weeping at home in their every-day
       finery. Their father was a commercial traveller, absent with
       his samples in Damascus most of the time; and the poor girl
       had no one to protect her from the outrage of exclusion from
       the parties to which she was not invited. She fretted and
       chafed very much at first, but after forbearance ceased to
       be a virtue it came rather natural to her to exercise a
       patient endurance. But perceiving this was agreeable to her
       sisters she abandoned it, devising a rare scheme of
       vengeance. She sent to the "Levant Herald" the following
       "personal" advertisement:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"G.V.&mdash;Regent's Canal 10.30 p.m., Q.K.X. is O.K.!
        With coals at 48 sh-ll-ngs I cannot endure existence
        without you! Ask for G-field St-ch. J.G. + &para; pro rata.
        B-tty's N-bob P-ckles. Oz-k-r-t! Meet me at the 'Turban and
        Scimitar,' Bebeck Road, Thursday morning at three o'clock;
        blue cotton umbrella, wooden shoes, and Ulster overskirt
        Polonaise all round the bottom.</p>

        <p>One Who Wants to Know Yer."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The latter half of this contained the gist of the whole
    matter; the other things were put in just to prevent the notice
    from being conspicuously sensible. Next morning, when the Grand
    Vizier took up his newspaper, he could not help knowing he was
    the person addressed; and at the appointed hour he kept the
    tryst. What passed between them the sequel will disclose, if I
    can think it out to suit me.</p>

    <p>Soon afterwards Djainan and Djulya received cards of
    invitation to a grand ball at the Sultan's palace, given to
    celebrate the arrival of a choice lot of Circassian beauties in
    the market. The first <span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"
       id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span> thing the wicked sisters
       did was to flourish these invitations triumphantly before
       the eyes of Pollimariar, who declared she did not believe a
       word of it; indeed, she professed such aggressive
       incredulity that she had to be severely beaten. But she
       denied the invitations to the last. She thought it was best
       to deny them.</p>

    <p>The invitations stated that at the proper hour the old
    original Sultana would call personally, and conduct the young
    ladies to the palace; and she did so. They thought, at the
    time, she bore a striking resemblance to a Grand Vizier with
    his beard shaven off, and this led them into some desultory
    reflections upon the sin of nepotism and family favour at
    Court; but, like all moral reflections, these came to nothing.
    The old original Sultana's attire, also, was, with the
    exception of a reticule and fan, conspicuously epicene; but, in
    a country where popular notions of sex are somewhat confused,
    this excited no surprise.</p>

    <p>As the three marched off in stately array, poor little
    deserted Pollimariar stood cowering at one side, with her
    fingers spread loosely upon her eyes, weeping like&mdash;a
    crocodile. The Sultana said it was late; they would have to
    make haste. She had not fetched a cab, however, and a recent
    inundation of dogs very much impeded their progress. By-and-by
    the dogs became shallower, but it was near eleven o'clock
    before they arrived at the Sublime Porte&mdash;very old and
    fruity. A janizary standing here split his visage to grin, but
    it was surprising how quickly the Sultana had his head off.</p>

    <p>Pretty soon afterwards they came to a low door, where the
    Sultana whistled three times and kicked at the panels. It soon
    yielded, disclosing two gigantic Nubian eunuchs, black as the
    ace of clubs, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"
       id="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span> who stared at first, but
       when shown a very cleverly-executed signet-ring of paste,
       knocked their heads against the ground with respectful
       violence. Then one of them consulted a thick book, and took
       from a secret drawer two metal badges numbered 7,394 and
       7,395, which he fastened about the necks of the now
       frightened girls, who had just observed that the Sultana had
       vanished. The numbers on the badges showed that this would
       be a very crowded ball.</p>

    <p>The other black now advanced with a measuring tape, and
    began gravely measuring Djainan from head to heel. She ventured
    to ask the sable guardian with what article of dress she was to
    be fitted.</p>

    <p>"Bedad, thin, av ye must know," said he, grinning, "it is to
    be a <i>sack</i>."</p>

    <p>"What! a <i>sacque</i> for a ball?"</p>

    <p>"Indade, it's right ye are, mavourneen; it is fer a
    ball&mdash;fer a cannon-ball&mdash;as will make yer purty body
    swim to the bothom nately as ony shtone."</p>

    <p>And the eunuch toyed lovingly with his measuring-tape, which
    the wretched girls now observed was singularly like a
    bow-string.</p>

    <p>"O, sister," shrieked Djainan, "this is&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"O, sister," shrieked Djulya, "this is&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"That horrid&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"That horrid&mdash;"</p>

    <p><i>"Harem!"</i></p>

    <p>It was even so. A minute later the betrayed maidens were
    carried, feet-foremost-and-fainting, through a particularly
    dirty portal, over which gleamed the infernal legend: "Who
    enters here leaves soap behind!" I wash my hands of them.</p>

    <h3>JOHN SMITH.</h3>

    <h3>AN EDITORIAL ARTICLE FROM A JOURNAL. OF MAY 3rd, A.D.
    3873.</h3>

    <p>At the quiet little village of Smithcester (the ancient
    London) will be celebrated to-day the twentieth, centennial
    anniversary of this remarkable man, the foremost figure of
    antiquity. The recurrence of what, no longer than six centuries
    ago, was a popular <i>f&ecirc;te</i> day, and which even now is
    seldom allowed to pass without some recognition by those to
    whom the word liberty means something more precious than gold,
    is provocative of peculiar emotion. It matters little whether
    or no tradition has correctly fixed the date of Smith's birth;
    that he <i>was</i> born&mdash;that being born he wrought nobly
    at the work his hand found to do&mdash;that by the mere force
    of his intellect he established our present perfect form of
    government, under which civilization has attained its highest
    and ripest development&mdash;these are facts beside which a
    mere question of chronology sinks into insignificance.</p>

    <p>That this extraordinary man originated the Smitharchic
    system of government is, perhaps, open to honest doubt; very
    possibly it had a <i>de facto</i> existence in various debased
    and uncertain shapes as early as the sixteenth century. But
    that he cleared it of its overlying errors and superstitions,
    gave it a definite form, and shaped it into an intelligible
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"
       id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span> scheme, there is the
       strongest evidence in the fragments of twentieth-century
       literature that have descended to us, disfigured though they
       are with amazingly contradictory statements of his birth,
       parentage, and manner of life before he strode upon the
       political stage as the liberator of mankind. It is stated
       that Snakeshear&mdash;one of his contemporaries, a poet
       whose works had in their day some reputation (though it is
       difficult to say why)&mdash;alludes to him as "the noblest
       Roman of them all;" our ancestors at the time being called
       Englishmen or Romans, indifferently. In the only fragment of
       Snakeshear extant, however, we have been unable to find this
       passage.</p>

    <p>Smith's military power is amply attested in an ancient
    manuscript of undoubted authenticity, which has just been
    translated from the Japanese. It is an account of the
    water-battle of Loo, by an eyewitness whose name,
    unfortunately, has not reached us. In this battle it is stated
    that Smith overthrew the great Neapolitan general, whom he
    captured and conveyed in chains to the island of
    Chickenhurst.</p>

    <p>In his Political History of the Twentieth Century, the late
    Mimble&mdash;or, as he would have been called in the time of
    which he writes, <i>Mister</i> Mimble&mdash;has this luminous
    sentence: "With the single exception of Coblentz, there was no
    European government the Liberator did not upset, and which he
    did not erect into a pure Smitharchy; and though some of them
    afterward relapsed temporarily into the crude forms of
    antiquity, and others fell into fanciful systems begotten of
    the intellectual activity he had stirred up, yet so firmly did
    he establish the principle, that in the Thirty-second Century
    the enlightened world was, what it has since remained,
    practically
    Smitharchic."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"
       id="page186"></a>[pg 186]</span>

    <p>It may be noted here as a curious coincidence, that the same
    year which saw the birth of him who established rational
    government witnessed the death of him who perfected literature.
    In 1873, Martin Farquhar Tupper&mdash;next to Smith the most
    notable name in history&mdash;died of starvation in the streets
    of London. Like that of Smith, his origin is wrapped in
    profoundest obscurity. No less than seven British cities
    claimed the honour of his birth. Meagre indeed is our knowledge
    of this only bard whose works have descended to us through the
    changes of twenty centuries entire. All that is positively
    established is that during his life he was editor of "The Times
    'magazine,'" a word of disputed meaning&mdash;and, as quaint
    old Dumbleshaw says, "an accomplished Greek and Latin scholar,"
    whatever "Greek" and "Latin" may have been. Had Smith and
    Tupper been contemporaries, the iron deeds of the former would
    doubtless have been immortalized in the golden pages of the
    latter. Upon such chances does History depend for her
    materials!</p>

    <p>Strangely unimpressible indeed must be the mind which,
    looking backward through the vista of twenty centuries upon the
    singular race from whom we are supposed to be descended, can
    repress a feeling of emotional interest. The names of John
    Smith and Martin Farquhar Tupper, blazoned upon the page of the
    dim past, and surrounded by the lesser names of Snakeshear, the
    first Neapolitan, Oliver Cornwell, Close, "Queen" Elizabeth, or
    Lambeth, the Dutch Bismarch, Julia C&aelig;sar, and a host of
    contemporary notables are singularly suggestive. They call to
    mind the odd old custom of covering the body with "clothes;"
    the curious error of Copernicus and other wide
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"
       id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span> guesses of antique
       "science;" the lost arts of telegramy, steam locomotion, and
       printing with movable types; and the exploded theory of
       gunpowder. They set us thinking upon the zealous idolatry
       which led men to make pious pilgrimages to the then
       accessible regions about the North Pole and into the
       interior of Africa, which at that time was but little better
       than a wilderness. They conjure up visions of bloodthirsty
       "Emperors," tyrannical "Kings," vampire "Presidents," and
       useless "Parliaments"&mdash;strangely horrible shapes
       contrasted with the serene and benevolent aspect of our
       modern Smithocracy!</p>

    <p>Let us to-day rejoice that the old order of things has for
    ever passed away; let us be thankful that our lot has been cast
    in more wholesome days than those in which John Smith chalked
    out the better destinies of a savage race, and Tupper sang
    divine philosophy to inattentive ears. And yet let us keep
    green the memory of whatever there was of good&mdash;if
    any&mdash;in the dark pre-Smithian ages, when men cherished
    quaint superstitions and rode on the backs of
    "horses"&mdash;when they passed <i>over</i> the seas instead of
    under them&mdash;when science had not yet dawned to chase away
    the shadows of imagination&mdash;and when the cabalistic
    letters A.D., which from habit we still affix to the numerals
    designating the age of the world, had perhaps a known
    signification.</p>

    <h3>SUNDERED HEARTS.</h3>

    <p>Deidrick Schwackenheimer was a lusty young goatherd. He
    stood six feet two in his <i>sabots</i>, and there was not an
    ounce of superfluous bone or brain in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"
       id="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span> his composition. If he had
       a fault, it was a tendency to sleep more than was strictly
       necessary. The nature of his calling fostered this weakness:
       after being turned into some neighbour's pasture, his
       animals would not require looking after until the owner of
       the soil turned them out again. Their guardian naturally
       devoted the interval to slumber. Nor was there danger of
       oversleeping: the pitchfork of the irate husbandman always
       roused him at the proper moment.</p>

    <p>At nightfall Deidrick would marshal his flock and drive it
    homeward to the milking-yard. Here he was met by the fair young
    Katrina Buttersprecht, the daughter of his employer, who
    relieved the tense udders of their daily secretion. One evening
    after the milking, Deidrick, who had for years been nourishing
    a secret passion for Katrina, was smitten with an idea. Why
    should she not be his wife? He went and fetched a stool into
    the yard, led her tenderly to it, seated her, and <i>asked</i>
    her why. The girl thought a moment, and then was at some pains
    to explain. She was too young. Her old father required all her
    care. Her little brother would cry. She was engaged to Max
    Manglewurzzle. She amplified considerably, but these were the
    essential points of objection. She set them before him
    <i>seriatim</i> with perfect frankness, and without mental
    reservation. When she had done, her lover, with that
    instinctive sense of honour characteristic of the true
    goatherd, made no attempt to alter her decision. Indeed, he had
    nodded a heart-broken assent to each separate proposition, and
    at the conclusion of the last was fast asleep. The next morning
    he jocundly drove his goats afield and appeared the same as
    usual, except that he slept a good deal more, and thought of
    Katrina a good deal
    less.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"
       id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/196.jpg"><img width="500"
             src="images/196.jpg"
             alt="Katrina and Deidrick" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>That evening when he returned with his spraddling
    milch-nannies, he found a second stool placed alongside the
    first. It was a happy augury; his attentions, then, were not
    altogether distasteful. He seated himself gravely upon the
    stool, and when Katrina had done milking, she came and occupied
    the other. He mechanically renewed his proposal. Then the
    artless maid proceeded to recapitulate the obstacles to the
    union. She was too young. Her old father required all her care.
    Her little brother would cry. She was engaged to Max
    Manglewurzzle. As each objection was stated and told off on the
    <i>fra&uuml;lein's</i> fingers, Deidrick nodded a resigned
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"
       id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span> acquiescence, and at the
       finish was fast asleep. Every evening after that Deidrick
       proposed in perfect good faith, the girl repeated her
       objections with equal candour, and they were received with
       somnolent approval. Love-making is very agreeable, and by
       the usuage of long years it becomes a confirmed habit. In
       less than a decade it became impossible for Katrina to enjoy
       her supper without the regular proposal, and Deidrick could
       not sleep of a night without the preliminary nap in the
       goat-yard to taper off his wakefulness. Both would have been
       wretched had they retired to bed with a shade of
       misunderstanding between them.</p>

    <p>And so the seasons went by. The earth grayed and greened
    herself anew; the planets sailed their appointed courses; the
    old goats died, and their virtues were perpetuated in their
    offspring. Max Manglewurzzle married the miller's daughter;
    Katrina's little brother, who would have cried at her wedding,
    did not cry any at his own; the aged Buttersprecht was long
    gathered to his fathers; and Katrina was herself well stricken
    in years. And still at fall of night she defined her position
    to the sleeping lover who had sought her hand&mdash;defined it
    in the self-same terms as upon that eventful eve. The gossiping
    <i>frauen</i> began to whisper it would be a match; but it did
    not look like it as yet. Slanderous tongues even asserted that
    it ought to have been a match long ago, but I don't see how it
    could have been, without the girl's consent. The parish clerk
    began to hanker after his fee; but, lacking patience, he was
    unreasonable.</p>

    <p>The whole countryside was now taking a deep interest in the
    affair. The aged did not wish to die without beholding the
    consummation of the love they had seen bud in their youth; and
    the young <span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"
       id="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span> did not wish to die at all.
       But no one liked to interfere; it was feared that counsel to
       the woman would be rejected, and a thrashing to the man
       would be misunderstood. At last the parson took heart of
       grace to make or mar the match. Like a reckless gambler he
       staked his fee upon the cast of a die. He went one day and
       removed the two stools&mdash;now worn extremely
       thin&mdash;to another corner of the milking-yard.</p>

    <p>That evening, when the distended udders had been duly
    despoiled, the lovers repaired to their trysting-place. They
    opened their eyes a bit to find the stools removed. They were
    tormented with a vague presentiment of evil, and stood for some
    minutes irresolute; then, assisted to a decision by their
    weakening knees, they seated themselves flat upon the ground.
    Deidrick stammered a weak proposal, and Katrina essayed an
    incoherent objection. But she trembled and became
    unintelligible; and when he attempted to throw in a few nods of
    generous approval they came in at the wrong places. With one
    accord they arose and sought their stools. Katrina tried it
    again. She succeeded in saying her father was over-young to
    marry, and Max Manglewurzzle would cry if she took care of him.
    Deidrick executed a reckless nod that made his neck snap, and
    was broad awake in a minute. A second time they arose. They
    conveyed the stools back to their primitive position, and began
    again. She remarked that her little brother was too old to
    require all her care, and Max would cry to marry her father.
    Deidrick addressed himself to sleep, but a horrid nightmare
    galloped rough-shod into his repose and set him off with a
    strangled snort. The good understanding between those two
    hearts was for ever dissipated; neither one knew if the other
    were afoot or on horseback. Like the sailor's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"
       id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span> thirtieth stroke with the
       rope's-end, it was perfectly disgusting! Their meetings
       after this were so embarrassing that they soon ceased
       meeting altogether. Katrina died soon after, a miserable
       broken-spirited maiden of sixty; and Deidrick drags out a
       wretched existence in a remote town, upon an income of eight
       <i>silbergroschen</i> a week.</p>

    <p>Oh, friends and brethren, if you did but know how slight an
    act may sunder for ever the bonds of love&mdash;how easily one
    may wreck the peace of two faithful hearts&mdash;how almost
    without an effort the waters of affection may be changed to
    gall and bitterness&mdash;I suspect you would make even more
    more mischief than you do now.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>THE EARLY HISTORY OF BATH.</h3>

    <p>Bladud was the eldest son of a British King (whose name I
    perfectly remember, but do not choose to write) <i>temp</i>.
    Solomon&mdash;who does not appear to have known Bladud,
    however. Bladud was, therefore, Prince of Wales. He was more
    than that: he was a leper&mdash;had it very bad, and the Court
    physician, Sir William Gull, frequently remarked that the
    Prince's death was merely a question of time. When a man gets
    to that stage of leprosy he does not care much for society,
    particularly if no one will have anything to do with him. So
    Bladud bade a final adieu to the world, and settled in
    Liverpool. But not agreeing with the climate, he folded his
    tent into the shape of an Arab, as Longfellow says, and
    silently stole away to the southward, bringing up in
    Gloucestershire.</p>

    <p>Here Bladud hired himself out to a farmer named
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"
       id="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span> Smith, as a swineherd. But
       Fate, as he expressed it in the vernacular, was "ferninst
       him." Leprosy is a contagious disease, within certain
       degrees of consanguinity, and by riding his pigs afield he
       communicated it to them; so that in a few weeks, barring the
       fact that they were hogs, they were no better off than he.
       Mr. Smith was an irritable old gentleman, so choleric he
       made his bondsmen tremble&mdash;though he was now abroad
       upon his own recognizances. Dreading his wrath, Bladud
       quitted his employ, without giving the usual week's notice,
       but so far conforming to custom in other respects as to take
       his master's pigs along with him.</p>

    <p>We find him next at a place called Swainswick&mdash;or
    Swineswig&mdash;a mile or two to the north-east of Bath, which,
    as yet, had no existence, its site being occupied by a smooth
    level reach of white sand, or a stormy pool of black water,
    travellers of the time disagree which. At Swainswick Bladud
    found his level; throwing aside all such nonsense as kingly
    ambition, and the amenities of civilized society&mdash;utterly
    ignoring the deceitful pleasures of common sense&mdash;he
    contented his simple soul with composing <i>bouts
    rim&eacute;s</i> for Lady Miller, at Batheaston Villa; that one
    upon a buttered muffin, falsely ascribed by Walpole to the
    Duchess of Northumberland, was really constructed by
    Bladud.</p>

    <p>A brief glance at the local history of the period cannot but
    prove instructive. Ralph Allen was then residing at Sham
    Castle, where Pope accused him of doing good like a thief in
    the night and blushing to find it unpopular. Fielding was
    painfully evolving "Tom Jones" from an inner consciousness that
    might have been improved by soap and any water but that of
    Bath. Bishop Warburton had just shot the Count Du Barr&eacute;
    in a duel with Lord Chesterfield; and Beau
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"
       id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span> Nash was disputing with Dr.
       Johnson, at the Pelican Inn, Walcot, upon a question of
       lexicographical etiquette. It is necessary to learn these
       things in order the better to appreciate the interest of
       what follows.</p>

    <p>During all this time Bladud never permitted his mind to
    permanently desert his calling; he found family matters a
    congenial study, and he thought of his swine a good deal, off
    and on. One day while baiting them amongst the hills, he
    observed a cloud of steam ascending from the valley below.
    Having always believed steam a modern invention, this ancient
    was surprised, and when his measly charge set up a wild squeal,
    rushing down a steep place into the aspiring vapour, his
    astonishment ripened into dismay. As soon as he conveniently
    could Bladud followed, and there he heard the saw&mdash;I mean
    he saw the herd wallowing and floundering multitudinously in a
    hot spring, and punctuating the silence of nature with grunts
    of quiet satisfaction, as the leprosy left them and clave to
    the waters&mdash;to which it cleaves yet. It is not probable
    the pigs went in there for a medicinal purpose; how could they
    know? Any butcher will tell you that a pig, after being
    assassinated, is invariably boiled to loosen the hair. By long
    usage the custom of getting into hot water has become a habit
    which the living pig inherits from the dead pork. (See Herbert
    Spencer on "Heredity.")</p>

    <p>Now Bladud (who is said to have studied at Athens, as most
    Britons of his time did) was a rigid disciple of Bishop Butler;
    and Butler's line of argument is this: Because a rose-bush
    blossoms this year, a lamppost will blossom next year. By this
    ingenious logic he proves the immortality of the human soul,
    which is good of him; but in so doing he proves, also, the
    immortality of the souls of snakes, mosquitos, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"
       id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span> everything else, which is
       less commendable. Reasoning by analogy, Bladud was convinced
       that if these waters would cure a pig, they would cure a
       prince: and without waiting to see <i>how</i> they had cured
       the bacon, he waded in.</p>

    <p>When asked the next day by Sir William Waller if he intended
    trying the waters again, and if he retained his fondness for
    that style of bathing, he replied, "Not any, thank you; I am
    quite cured!" Sir William at once noised abroad the story of
    the wonderful healing, and when it reached the king's ears,
    that potentate sent for Bladud to "come home at once and
    succeed to the throne, just the same as if he had a
    skin"&mdash;which Bladud did. Some time afterwards he thought
    to outdo D&aelig;dalus and Icarus, by flying from the top of
    St. Paul's Cathedral. He outdid them handsomely; he fell a good
    deal harder than they did, and broke his precious neck.</p>

    <p>Previously to his melancholy end he built the City of Bath,
    to commemorate his remarkable cure. He endowed the Corporation
    with ten millions sterling, every penny of the interest of
    which is annually devoted to the publication of guide-books to
    Bath, to lure the unwary invalid to his doom. From motives of
    mercy the Corporation have now set up a contrivance for
    secretly extracting the mineral properties of the fluid before
    it is ladled out, but formerly a great number of strangers
    found a watery grave.</p>

    <p>If King Bladud was generous to Bath, Bath has been grateful
    in return. One statue of him adorns the principal street, and
    another graces the swimming pond, both speaking likenesses. The
    one represents him as he was before he divided his leprosy with
    the pigs; the other shows him as he appeared after breaking his
    neck.</p>

    <p>Writing in 1631, Dr. Jordan says: "The baths are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"
       id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span> bear-gardens, where both
       sexes bathe promiscuously, while the passers-by pelt them
       with dead dogs, cats, and pigs; and even human creatures are
       hurled over the rails into the water." It is not so bad as
       that now, but lodgings are still held at rates which might
       be advantageously tempered to the shorn.</p>

    <p>I append the result of a chemical analysis I caused to be
    made of these incomparable Waters, that the fame of their
    virtues may no longer rest upon the inadequate basis of their
    observed effects.</p>

    <p>One hundred parts of the water contain:</p>

    <h3>THE FOLLOWING DORG.</h3>

    <p>Dad Petto, as everybody called him, had a dog, upon whom he
    lavished an amount of affection which, had it been disbursed in
    a proper quarter, would have been adequate to the sentimental
    needs of a dozen brace of lovers. The name of this dog was
    Jerusalem, but it might more properly have been
    Dan-to-Beersheba. He was not a fascinating dog to look at; you
    can buy a handsomer dog in any shop than this one. He had
    neither a graceful <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
       id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> exterior nor an engaging
       address. On the contrary, his exceptional plainness had
       passed into a local proverb; and such was the inbred
       coarseness of his demeanour, that in the dark you might have
       thought him a politician.</p>

    <p>If you will take two very bandy-legged curs, cut one off
    just abaft the shoulders, and the other immediately forward of
    the haunches, rejecting the fore-part of the first and the rear
    portion of the second, you will have the raw material for
    constructing a dog something like Dad Petto's. You have only to
    effect a junction between the accepted sections, and make the
    thing eat.</p>

    <p>Had he been favoured with as many pairs of legs as a
    centipede, Jerusalem would not have differed materially from
    either of his race; but it was odd to see such a wealth of dog
    wedded to such a poverty of leg. He was so long that the most
    precocious pupil of the public schools could not have committed
    him to memory in a week.</p>

    <p>It was beautiful to see Jerusalem rounding the angle of a
    wall, and turning his head about to observe how the remainder
    of the procession was coming on. He was once circumnavigating a
    small out-house, when, catching sight of his own
    hinder-quarters, he flew into a terrible rage. The sight of
    another dog always had this effect upon Jerusalem, and more
    especially when, as in this case, he thought he could grasp an
    unfair advantage. So Jerusalem took after that retreating foe
    as hard as ever he could hook it. Round and round he flew, but
    the faster he went, the more his centrifugal force widened his
    circle, until he presently lost sight of his enemy altogether.
    Then he slowed down, determined to accomplish his end by
    strategy. Sneaking closely up to the wall, he moved cautiously
    forward, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"
       id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span> when he had made the full
       circuit, he came smack up against his own tail. Making a
       sudden spring, which must have stretched him like a bit of
       India-rubber, he fastened his teeth into his ham, hanging on
       like a country visitor. He felt sure he had nailed the other
       dog, but he was equally confident the other dog had nailed
       him; so the problem was simplified to a mere question of
       endurance&mdash;and Jerusalem was an animal of pluck. The
       grim conflict was maintained all one day&mdash;maintained
       with deathless perseverance, until Dad Petto discovered the
       belligerent and uncoupled him. Then Jerusalem looked up at
       his master with a shake of the head, as much as to say:
       "It's a precious opportune arrival for the other pup; but
       who took <i>him</i> off <i>me</i>?"</p>

    <p>I don't think I can better illustrate the preposterous
    longitude of this pet, than by relating an incident that fell
    under my own observation. I was one day walking along the
    highway with a friend who was a stranger in the neighbourhood,
    when a rabbit flashed past us, going our way, but evidently
    upon urgent business. Immediately upon his heels followed the
    first instalment of Dad Petto's mongrel, enveloped in dust, his
    jaws distended, the lower one shaving the ground to scoop up
    the rabbit. He was going at a rather lively gait, but was some
    time in passing. My friend stood a few moments looking on; then
    rubbed his eyes, looked again, and finally turned to me, just
    as the brute's tail flitted by, saying, with a broad stare of
    astonishment:</p>

    <p>"Did you ever see a pack of hounds run so perfectly in line?
    It beats anything! And the speed, too&mdash;they seem fairly
    blended! If a fellow didn't know better, he would swear there
    was but a single dog!"</p>

    <p>I suppose it was this peculiarity of Jerusalem that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"
       id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span> had won old Petto's regard.
       He liked as much of anything as he could have for his money;
       and the expense of this creature, generally speaking, was no
       greater than that of a brief succinct bull pup. But there
       were times when he was costly. All dogs are sometimes "off
       their feed"&mdash;will eat nothing for a whole day but a few
       ox-tails, a pudding or two, and such towelling as they can
       pick up in the scullery. When Jerusalem got that way, which,
       to do him justice, was singularly seldom, it made things
       awkward in the near future. For in a few days after
       recovering his passion for food, the effect of his former
       abstemiousness would begin to reach his stomach; but of
       course all he could <i>then</i> devour would work no
       immediate relief. This he would naturally attribute to the
       quality of his fare, and would change his diet a dozen times
       a day, his <i>menu</i> in the twelve working hours
       comprising an astonishing range of articles, from a wood-saw
       to a kettle of soft soap&mdash;edibles as widely dissimilar
       as the zenith and the nadir, which, also, he would eat. So
       catholic an appetite was, of course, exceptional: ordinarily
       Jerusalem was as narrow and illiberal as the best of us.
       Give him plenty of raw beef, and he would not unsettle his
       gastric faith by outside speculation or tentative
       systems.</p>

    <p>I could relate things of this dog by the hour. Such, for
    example, as his clever device for crossing a railway. He never
    attempted to do this endwise, like other animals, for the
    obvious reason that, like every one else, he was unable to make
    any sense of the time-tables; and unless he should by good luck
    begin the manoeuvre when a train was said to be due, it was
    likely he would be abbreviated; for of course no one is idiot
    enough to cross a railway track when the time-table says it is
    all clear&mdash;at least no one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"
       id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span> as long as Jerusalem. So he
       would advance his head to the rails, calling in his outlying
       convolutions, and straightening them alongside the track,
       parallel with it; and then at a signal previously agreed
       upon&mdash;a short wild bark&mdash;this sagacious dog would
       make the transit unanimously, as it were. By this method he
       commonly avoided a quarrel with the engine.</p>

    <p>Altogether he was a very interesting beast, and his master
    was fond of him no end. And with the exception of compelling
    Mr. Petto to remove to the centre of the State to avoid double
    taxation upon him, he was not wholly unprofitable; for he was
    the best sheep-dog in the country: he always kept the flock
    well together by the simple device of surrounding them. Having
    done so, he would lie down, and eat, and eat, and eat, till
    there wasn't a sheep left, except a few old rancid ones; and
    even those he would tear into small spring lambs.</p>

    <p>Dad Petto never went anywhere without the superior portion
    of Jerusalem at his side; and he always alluded to him as "the
    following dorg." But the beast finally became a great nuisance
    in Illinois. His body obstructed the roads in all directions;
    and the Representative of that district in the National
    Congress was instructed by his constituents to bring in a bill
    taxing dogs by the linear yard, instead of by the head, as the
    law then stood. Dad Petto proceeded at once to Washington to
    "lobby" against the measure. He knew the wife of a clerk in the
    Bureau of Statistics; armed with this influence he felt
    confident of success. I was myself in Washington, at the time,
    trying to secure the removal of a postmaster who was personally
    obnoxious to me, inasmuch as I had been strongly recommended
    for the position by some leading citizens, who to their high
    political characters superadded the more substantial merit of
    being my relations.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"
       id="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span>

    <p>Dad and I were standing, one morning, in front of Willard's
    Hotel, when he stooped over and began patting Jerusalem on the
    head. All of a sudden the smiling brute sprang open his mouth
    and bade farewell to a succession of yells which speedily
    collected ten thousand miserable office-seekers, and an equal
    quantity of brigadier-generals, who, all in a breath, inquired
    who had been stabbed, and what was the name of the lady.</p>

    <p>Meantime nothing would pacify the pup; he howled most
    dismally, punctuating his wails with quick sharp shrieks of
    mortal agony. More than an hour&mdash;more than two
    hours&mdash;we strove to discover and allay the canine
    grievance, but to no purpose.</p>

    <p>Presently one of the hotel pages stepped up to Mr. Petto,
    handing him a telegraphic dispatch just received. It was dated
    at his home in Cowville, Illinois, and making allowance for the
    difference in time, something more than two hours previously.
    It read as follows:</p>

    <p>"A pot of boiling glue has just been upset upon Jerusalem's
    hind-quarters. Shall I try rhubarb, or let it get cold and
    chisel it off?</p>

    <p>"P.S. He did it himself, wagging his tail in the kitchen.
    Some Democrat has been bribing that dog with cold
    victuals.&mdash;PENELOPE PETTO."</p>

    <p>Then we knew what ailed "the following dorg."</p>

    <p>I should like to go on giving the reader a short account of
    this animal's more striking personal peculiarities, but the
    subject seems to grow under my hand. The longer I write, the
    longer he becomes, and the more there is to tell; and after
    all, I shall not get a copper more for pourtraying all this
    length of dog than I would for depicting an orbicular
    pig.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"
       id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span>

    <h3>SNAKING.</h3>

    <p>Very talkative people always seemed to me to be divided into
    two classes&mdash;those who lie for a purpose and those who lie
    for the love of lying; and Sam Baxter belonged, with broad
    impartiality, to both. With him falsehood was not more
    frequently a means than an end; for he would not only lie
    without a purpose but at a sacrifice. I heard him once reading
    a newspaper to a blind aunt, and deliberately falsifying the
    market reports. The good old lady took it all in with a
    trustful faith, until he quoted dried apples at fifty cents a
    yard for unbolted sides; then she arose and disinherited him.
    Sam seemed to regard the fountain of truth as a stagnant pool,
    and himself an angel whose business it was to stand by and
    trouble the waters.</p>

    <p>"You know Ben Dean," said Sam to me one day; "I'm down on
    that fellow, and I'll tell you why. In the winter of '68 he and
    I were snaking together in the mountains north of the Big
    Sandy."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean by snaking, Sam?"</p>

    <p>"Well, <i>I</i> like <i>that</i>! Why, gathering snakes, to
    be sure&mdash;rattlesnakes for zoological gardens, museums, and
    side-shows to circuses. This is how it is done: a party of
    snakers go up to the mountains in the early autumn, with
    provisions for all winter, and putting up a snakery at some
    central point, get to work as soon as the torpid season sets
    in, and before there is much snow. I presume you know that when
    the nights begin to get cold, the snakes go in under big flat
    stones, snuggle together, and lie there frozen stiff until the
    warm days of spring limber them up for business.</p>

    <p>"We go about, raise up the rocks, tie the worms
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"
       id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span> into convenient bundles and
       carry them to the snakery, where, during the snow season,
       they are assorted, labelled according to quality, and packed
       away for transportation. Sometimes a single showman will
       have as many as a dozen snakers in the mountains all
       winter.</p>

    <p>"Ben and I were out, one day, and had gathered a few sheaves
    of prime ones, when we discovered a broad stone that showed
    good indications, but we couldn't raise it. The whole upper
    part of the mountain seemed to be built mostly upon this one
    stone. There was nothing to be done but mole it&mdash;dig
    under, you know; so taking the spade I soon widened the hole
    the creatures had got in at, until it would admit my body.
    Crawling in, I found a kind of cell in the solid rock, stowed
    nearly full of beautiful serpents, some of them as long as a
    man. You would have revelled in those worms! They were neatly
    disposed about the sides of the cave, an even dozen in each
    berth, and some odd ones swinging from the ceiling in hammocks,
    like sailors. By the time I had counted them roughly, as they
    lay, it was dark, and snowing like the mischief. There was no
    getting back to head-quarters that night, and there was room
    for but one of us inside."</p>

    <p>"Inside what, Sam?"</p>

    <p>"See here! have you been listening to what I'm telling you,
    or not? There is no use telling <i>you</i> anything. Perhaps
    you won't mind waiting till I get done, and then you can tell
    something of your own. We drew straws to decide who should
    sleep inside, and it fell to me. Such luck as that fellow Ben
    always had drawing straws when I held them! It was sinful! But
    even inside it was coldish, and I was more than an hour getting
    asleep. Toward morning, though, I woke, feeling very warm and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"
       id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span> peaceful. The moon was at
       full, just rising in the valley below, and, shining in at
       the hole I'd entered at, it made everything light as
       day."</p>

    <p>"But, Sam, according to <i>my</i> astronomy a full moon
    never rises towards morning."</p>

    <p>"Now, who said anything about your astronomy? I'd like to
    know who is telling this&mdash;you or I? Always think you know
    more than I do&mdash;and always swearing it isn't so&mdash;and
    always taking the words out of my mouth, and&mdash;but what's
    the use of arguing with <i>you</i>? As I was saying, the snakes
    began waking about the same time I did; I could hear them turn
    over on their other sides and sigh. Presently one raised
    himself up and yawned. He meant well, but it was not the
    regular thing for an ophidian to do at that season. By-and-by
    they began to poke their heads up all round, nodding good
    morning to one another across the room; and pretty soon one saw
    me lying there and called attention to the fact. Then they all
    began to crowd to the front and hang out over the sides of the
    beds in a fringe, to study my habits. I can't describe the
    strange spectacle: you would have supposed it was the middle of
    March and a forward season! There were more worms than I had
    counted, and they were larger ones than I had thought. And the
    more they got awake the wider they yawned, and the longer they
    stretched. The fat fellows in the hammocks above me were in
    danger of toppling out and breaking their necks every
    minute.</p>

    <p>"Then it went through my mind like a flash what was the
    matter. Finding it cold outside, Ben had made a roaring fire on
    the top of the rock, and the heat had deceived the worms into
    the belief that it was late spring. As I lay there and thought
    of a full-grown man who hadn't any better sense than
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"
       id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span> to do such a thing as
       <i>that</i>, I was mad enough to kill him. I lost confidence
       in mankind. If I had not stopped up the entrance before
       lying down, with a big round stone which the heat had
       swollen so that a hydraulic ram couldn't have butted it
       loose, I should have put on my clothes and gone straight
       home."</p>

    <p>"But, Sam, you said the entrance was open, and the moon
    shining in."</p>

    <p>"There you go again! Always contradicting&mdash;and
    insinuating that the moon must remain for hours in one
    position&mdash;and saying you've heard it told better by some
    one else&mdash;and wanting to fight! I've told this story to
    your brother over at Milk River more than a hundred million
    times, and he never said a word against it."</p>

    <p>"I believe you, Samuel; for he is deaf as a tombstone."</p>

    <p>"Tell you what to do for him! I know a fellow in Smith's
    Valley will cure him in a minute. That fellow has cleaned the
    deafness all out of Washington County a dozen times. I never
    knew a case of it that could stand up against him ten seconds.
    Take three parts of snake-root to a gallon of waggon-grease,
    and&mdash;I'll go and see if I can find the prescription!"</p>

    <p>And Sam was off like a rocket.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>MAUD'S PAPA.</h3>

    <p>That is she in the old black silk&mdash;the one with the
    gimlet curls and the accelerated lap-cat. Doesn't she average
    about as I set her forth?</p>

    <p>"Never told you anything about her?" Well, I
    will.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"
       id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span>

    <p>Twenty years ago, many a young man, of otherwise good
    character, would have ameliorated his condition for that girl;
    and would have thought himself overpaid if she had restored a
    fosy on his sepulchre. Maud would have been of the same
    opinion&mdash;and wouldn't have construed the fosy. And she was
    the most sagacious girl I ever experienced! As you shall
    hear.</p>

    <p>I was her lover, and she was mine. We loved ourselves to
    detraction. Maud lived a mile from any other house&mdash;except
    one brick barn. Not even a watch-dog about the
    place&mdash;except her father. This pompous old weakling hated
    me boisterously; he said I was dedicated to hard drink, and
    when in that condition was perfectly incompatible. I did not
    like him, too.</p>

    <p>One evening I called on Maud, and was surprised to meet her
    at the gate, with a shawl drawn over her head, and apparently
    in great combustion. She told me, hastily, the old man was ill
    of a fever, and had nearly derided her by going crazy.</p>

    <p>This was all a lie; something had gone wrong with the old
    party's eyes&mdash;amanuensis of the equinox, or something; he
    couldn't see well, but he was no more crazy than I was
    sober.</p>

    <p>"I was sitting quietly by him," said Maud, "when he sat up
    in bed and be-<i>gan!</i> You never in all your born life! I'm
    so glad you've come; you can take care of him while I fetch the
    doctor. He's quiet enough now, but you just wait till he gets
    another paralogism. When <i>they</i>'re on&mdash;oh my! You
    mustn't let him talk, nor get out of bed; doctor says it would
    prolong the diagnosis. Go right in, now. Oh dear! whatever
    shall I ought to do?"</p>

    <p>And, blowing her eyes on the corner of her shawl, Maud shot
    away like a comic.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"
       id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span>

    <p>I walked hurriedly into the house, and entered the old man's
    dromedary, without knocking.</p>

    <p>The playful girl had left that room a moment before, with
    every appearance of being frightened. She had told the old one
    there was a robber in the house, and the venerable invalid was
    a howling coward&mdash;I tell you this because I scorn to
    deceive you.</p>

    <p>I found the old gentleman with his head under the blankets,
    very quiet and speaceful: but the moment he heard me he got up,
    and yelled like a heliotrope. Then he fixed on me a wild
    spiercing look from his bloodshot eyes, and for the first time
    in my life I believed Maud had told me the truth for the first
    time in hers. Then he reached out for a heavy cane. But I was
    too punctual for him, and, clapping my hand on his breast, I
    crowded him down, holding him tight. He curvetted some; then
    lay still, and swore weak oaths that wouldn't have hurt a sick
    chicken! All this time I was firm as a rock of amaranth.
    Presently, moreover, he spoke very low and resigned
    like&mdash;except his teeth chattered:</p>

    <p>"Desperate man, there is no need; you will find it to the
    north-west corner of my upper secretary drawer. I spromise not
    to appear."</p>

    <p>"All right, my lobster-snouted bulbul," said I, delighted
    with the importunity of abusing him; "that is the dryest place
    you could keep it in, old spoolcotton! Be sure you don't let
    the light get to it, angleworm! Meantime, therefore, you must
    take this draught."</p>

    <p>"Draught!" he shrieked, meandering from the subject. "O my
    poor child!"&mdash;and he sprang up again, screaming a multiple
    of things.</p>

    <p>I had him by the shoulders in a minute, and crushed him
    back&mdash;except his legs kept agitating.</p>

    <p>"Keep still, will you?" said I, "you sugarcoated
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"
       id="page208"></a>[pg 208]</span> old mandible, or I'll
       conciliate your exegesis with a proletarian!"</p>

    <p>I never had such a flow of language in my life; I could say
    anything I wanted to.</p>

    <p>He quailed at that threat, for, deleterious as I thought
    him, he saw I meant it; but he affected to prefer it that way
    to taking it out of the bottle.</p>

    <p>"Better," he moaned, "better even that than the poison.
    Spare me the poisoned chalice, and you may do it in the way you
    mention."</p>

    <p>The "draught," it may be sproper to explain, was comprised
    in a large bottle sitting on the table. I thought it was
    medicine&mdash;except it was black&mdash;and although Maud
    (sweet screature!) had not told me to give him anything, I felt
    sure this was nasty enough for him, or anybody. And it was; it
    was ink. So I treated his proposed compromise with silent
    contempt, merely remarking, as I uncorked the bottle:
    "Medicine's medicine, my fine friend; and it is for the sick."
    Then, spinioning his arms with one of mine, I concerted the
    neck of the bottle between his teeth.</p>

    <p>"Now, you lacustrine old cylinder-escapement," I exclaimed,
    with some warmth, "hand up your stomach for this healing
    precoction, or I'm blest if I won't controvert your <i>raison
    d'&ecirc;tre!</i>"</p>

    <p>He struggled hard, but, owing to my habit of finishing what
    I undertake, without any success. In ten minutes it was all
    down&mdash;except that some of it was spouted about rather
    circumstantially over the bedding, and walls, and me. There was
    more of the draught than I had thought. As he had been two days
    ill, I had supposed the bottle must be nearly empty; but, of
    course, when you think of it, a man doesn't abrogate much ink
    in an ordinary attack&mdash;except
    editors.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"
       id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>

    <p>Just as I got my knees off the spatient's breast, Maud
    peeped in at the door. She had remained in the lane till she
    thought the charm had had time to hibernate, then came in to
    have her laugh. She began having it, gently; but seeing me with
    the empty bottle in my sable hand, and the murky inspiration
    rolling off my face in gasconades, she got graver, and came in
    very soberly.</p>

    <p>Wherewith, the draught had done its duty, and the old
    gentleman was enjoying the first rest he had known since I came
    to heal him. He is enjoying it yet, for he was as dead as a
    monogram.</p>

    <p>As there was a good deal of scandal about my killing a
    sprospective father-in-law, I had to live it down by not
    marrying Maud&mdash;who has lived single, as a rule, ever
    since. All this epigastric tercentenary might have been avoided
    if she had only allowed a good deal of margin for my probable
    condition when she splanned her little practicable joke.</p>

    <p>"Why didn't they hang me?"&mdash;-Waiter, bring me a brandy
    spunch.&mdash;Well, that is the most didactic question! But if
    you must know&mdash;they did.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>JIM BECKWOURTH'S POND.</h3>

    <p>Not long after <i>that</i> (said old Jim Beckwourth,
    beginning a new story) there was a party of about a dozen of us
    down in the Powder River country, after buffalo. It was the
    <i>worst</i> place! Just think of the most barren and sterile
    spot you ever saw, or ever will see. Now take that spot and
    double it: that is where <i>we</i> were. One day, about noon,
    we halted near a sickly little <i>arroyo</i>, that was just
    damp enough to have deluded some feeble bunches of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"
       id="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span> bonnet-wire into setting up
       as grass along its banks. After picketing the horses and
       pack-mules we took luncheon, and then, while the others
       smoked and played cards for half-dollars, I took my rifle
       and strolled off into the hills to see if I could find a
       blind rabbit, or a lame antelope, that had been unable to
       leave the country. As I went on I heard, at intervals of
       about a quarter of an hour, a strange throbbing sound, as of
       smothered thunder, which grew more distinct as I advanced.
       Presently I came upon a lake of near a mile in diameter, and
       almost circular. It was as calm and even as a mirror, but I
       could see by a light steamy haze above it that the water was
       nearly at boiling heat&mdash;a not very uncommon
       circumstance in that region. While I looked, big bubbles
       began to rise to the surface, chase one another about, and
       burst; and suddenly, without any other preliminary movement,
       there occurred the most awful and astounding event that
       (with a single exception) it has ever been my lot to
       witness! I stood rooted to the spot with horror, and when it
       was all over, and again the lake lay smiling placidly before
       me, I silently thanked Heaven I had been standing at some
       distance from the deceitful pool. In a quarter of an hour
       the frightful scene was repeated, preceded as before by the
       rising and bursting of bubbles, and producing in me the
       utmost terror; but after seeing it three or four times I
       became calm. Then I went back to camp, and told the boys
       there was a tolerably interesting pond near by, if they
       cared for such things.</p>

    <p>At first they did not, but when I had thrown in a few lies
    about the brilliant hues of the water, and the great number of
    swans, they laid down their cards, left Lame Dave to look after
    the horses, and followed me back to see. Just before we crossed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"
       id="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span> the last range of hills we
       heard a thundering sound ahead, which somewhat astonished
       the boys, but I said nothing till we stood on a low knoll
       overlooking the lake. There it lay, as peaceful as a dead
       Indian, of a dull grey colour, and as innocent of water-fowl
       as a new-born babe.</p>

    <p>"There!" said I, triumphantly, pointing to it.</p>

    <p>"Well," said Bill Buckster, leaning on his rifle and
    surveying it critically, "what's the matter with the pond? I
    don't see nothin' in <i>that</i> puddle."</p>

    <p>"Whar's yer swans?" asked Gus Jamison.</p>

    <p>"And yer prismatic warter?" added Stumpy Jack.</p>

    <p>"Well, I like <i>this!</i>" drawled Frenchwoman Pete. "What
    'n thunder d' ye mean, you derned saddle-coloured fraud?"</p>

    <p>I was a little nettled at all this, particularly as the lake
    seemed to have buried the hatchet for that day; but I thought I
    would "cheek it through."</p>

    <p>"Just you wait!" I replied, significantly.</p>

    <p>"O yes!" exclaimed Stumpy, derisively; "'course, boys, you
    mus' <i>wait</i>. 'Tain't no use a-hurryin' up the cattle; yer
    mustn't rush the buck. Jest wait till some feller comes along
    with a melted rainbow, and lays on the war-paint! and another
    feller fetches the swans' eggs, and sets on 'em, and hatches
    'em out!&mdash;and me a-holding both bowers an' the ace!" he
    added, regretfully, thinking of the certainty he had left, to
    follow a delusive hope.</p>

    <p>Then I pointed out to them a wide margin of wet and steaming
    clay surrounding the water on all sides, asking them if
    <i>that</i> wasn't worth coming to see.</p>

    <p>"<i>That</i>!" exclaimed Gus. "I've seen the same thing a
    thousand million times! It's the reg'lar thing in Idaho. Clay
    soaks up the water and sweats it out."</p>

    <p>To verify his theory he started away, down to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"
       id="page212"></a>[pg 212]</span> the shore. I was concerned
       for Gus, but I did not dare call him back for fear of
       betraying my secret in some way. Besides, I knew he would
       not come; and he ought not to have been so sceptical,
       anyhow.</p>

    <p>Just then two or three big bubbles rose to the surface, and
    silently exploded. Quick as lightning I dropped on my knees and
    raised my arms.</p>

    <p>"Now may Heaven grant my prayer," I began with awful
    solemnity, "and send the great Ranunculus to loose the binding
    chain of concupiscence, heaving the multitudinous aquacity upon
    the heads of this wicked and sententious generation, whelming
    these diametrical scoffers in a supercilious
    Constantinople!"</p>

    <p>I knew the long words would impress their simple souls with
    a belief that I was actually praying; and I was right, for
    every man of them pulled his hat off, and stood staring at me
    with a mixed look of reverence, incredulity, and
    astonishment&mdash;but not for long. For before I could say
    amen, yours truly, or anything, that entire body of water shot
    upward five hundred feet into the air, as smooth as a column of
    crystal, curled over in broad green cataracts, falling outward
    with a jar and thunder like the explosion of a thousand
    subterranean cannon, then surging and swirling back to the
    centre, one steaming, writhing mass of snowy foam!</p>

    <p>As I rose to my feet to put my hand in my pocket for a chew
    of tobacco, I looked complacently about upon my comrades.
    Stumpy Jack stood paralysed, his head thrown back at an
    alarming angle, precisely as he had tilted it to watch the
    ascending column, and his neck somehow out of joint, holding it
    there. All the others were down upon their marrow-bones, white
    with terror, praying <span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"
       id="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span> with extraordinary
       fervency, each trying his best to master the ridiculous
       jargon they had heard me use, but employing it with an even
       greater disregard of sense and fitness than I did. Away over
       on the next range of hills, toward camp, was something that
       looked like a giant spider, scrambling up the steep side of
       the sand-hill, and sliding down a trifle faster than it got
       up. It was Lame Dave, who had abandoned his equine trust, to
       come up at the eleventh hour and see the swans. He had seen
       enough, and was now trying, in his weak way, to get back to
       camp.</p>

    <p>In a few minutes I had got Stumpy's head back into the
    position assigned it by Nature, had crowded his eyes in, and
    was going about with a reassuring smile, helping the pious upon
    their feet. Not a word was spoken; I took the lead, and we
    strode solemnly to camp, picking up Lame Dave at the foot of
    his acclivity, played a little game for Gus Jamison's horse and
    "calamities," then mounted our steeds, departing thence. Three
    or four days afterward I ventured cautiously upon a covert
    allusion to peculiar lakes, but the simultaneous clicking of
    ten revolvers convinced me that I need not trouble myself to
    pursue the subject.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>STRINGING A BEAR.</h3>

    <p>"I was looking for my horse one morning, up in the San
    Joaquin Valley," said old Sandy Fowler, absently stirring the
    camp fire, "when I saw a big bull grizzly lying in the
    sunshine, picking his teeth with his claws, and smiling, as if
    he said, 'You need not mind the horse, old fellow; he's been
    found.' <span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"
       id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span> I at once gave a loud
       whoop, which I thought would be heard by the boys in the
       camp, and prepared to string the brute."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I know how it goes," interrupted Smarty Mellor, as we
    called him; "seen it done heaps o' times! Six or eight o' ye
    rides up to the b'ar, and s'rounds him, every son-of-a-gun with
    a <i>riata</i> a mile long, and worries him till he gits his
    mad up, and while he's a-chasin' one feller the others is
    a-goin' &auml;ter him, and a-floorin' of him by loopin' his
    feet as they comes up behind, and when he turns onto them
    fellers the other chappy turns onto him, and puts another loop
    onto his feet as they comes up behind, and then&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I bound my <i>riata</i> tightly about my wrist," resumed
    old Sandy, composedly, "so that the beast should not jerk away
    when I had got him. Then I advanced upon him&mdash;very slowly,
    so as not to frighten him away. Seeing me coming, he rose upon
    his haunches, to have a look at me. He was about the size of a
    house&mdash;say a small two-storey house, with a Mansard roof.
    I paused a moment, to take another turn of the thong about my
    wrist.</p>

    <p>"Again I moved obliquely forward, trying to look as if I
    were thinking about the new waterworks in San Francisco, or the
    next presidential election, so as not to frighten him away. The
    brute now rose squarely upon end, with his paws suspended
    before him, like a dog begging for a biscuit, and I thought
    what a very large biscuit he must be begging for! Halting a
    moment, to see if the <i>riata</i> was likely to cut into my
    wrist, I perceived the beast had an inkling of my design, and
    was trying stupidly to stretch his head up out of reach.</p>

    <p>"I now threw off all disguise, and whirled my cord with a
    wide circular sweep, and in another
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"
       id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span> moment it would have been
       very unpleasant for Bruin, but somehow the line appeared to
       get foul. While I was opening the noose, the animal settled
       upon his feet and came toward me; but the moment he saw me
       begin to whirl again, he got frightened, up-ended himself as
       before, and shut his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Then I felt in my belt to see if my knife was there, when
    the bear got down again and came forward, utterly
    regardless.</p>

    <p>"Seeing he was frightened and trying to escape by coming so
    close I could not have a fair fling at him, I dropped the noose
    on the ground and walked away, trailing the line behind me.
    When it was all run out, the rascal arrived at the loop. He
    first smelled it, then opened it with his paws, and putting it
    about his neck, tilted up again, and nodded significantly.</p>

    <p>"I pulled out my knife, and severing the line at my wrist,
    walked away, looking for some one to introduce me to Smarty
    Mellor."</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
